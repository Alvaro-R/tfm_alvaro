  abstract = {Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas and has caused devastation of human populations affected in these regions. The virus causes teratogenic effects involving the nervous system, and in adults and children can cause a neuropathy similar to Guillain-Barre syndrome, an anterior myelitis, or, rarely, an encephalitis. While major efforts have been undertaken to control mosquito populations that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine, drug development that directly targets the virus in an infected individual to prevent or treat the neurological manifestations is necessary. Rational and targeted drug development is possible since the viral life cycle and the structure of the key viral proteins are now well understood. While several groups have identified therapeutic candidates, their approaches differ in the types of screening processes and viral assays used. Animal studies are available for only a few compounds. Here we provide an exhaustive review and compare each of the classes of drugs discovered, the methods used for drug discovery, and their potential use in humans for the prevention or treatment of neurological complications of Zika virus infection.},

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, has caused outbreaks in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and, more recently, in the Americas. ZIKV has been associated with the neurological autoimmune disorder Guillain\textendash Barre syndrome in adults and congenital Zika syndrome in fetuses and infants, including microcephaly, spontaneous abortion, and intrauterine growth restriction. It is considered to be a major threat to global public health due to its unprecedented clinical impact on humans. Currently, there are no specific prophylactics or therapeutics available to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. The development of a safe and efficacious ZIKV vaccine remains a global health priority. Since the recent outbreak, multiple platforms have been used in the development of candidate ZIKV vaccines. The candidate vaccines have been shown to elicit strong T cell and neutralization antibody responses and protect against ZIKV infection in animal models. Some candidates have progressed successfully to clinical trials. Live-attenuated vaccines, which induce rapid and durable protective immunity, are one of the most important strategies for controlling flavivirus diseases. In this review, we discuss recent progress in the development of candidate live-attenuated ZIKV vaccines.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Recent studies have clearly underscored the association between Zika virus (ZIKV) and severe neurological diseases such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Given the historical complacency surrounding this virus, however, no significant antiviral screenings have been performed to specifically target ZIKV. As a result, there is an urgent need for a validated screening method and strategy that is focused on highlighting potential anti-ZIKV inhibitors that can be further advanced via rigorous validation and optimization. To address this critical gap, we sought to test whether a cell-based assay that measures protection from the ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect could serve as a high-throughput screen assay for discovering novel anti-ZIKV inhibitors. Employing this approach, we tested the anti-ZIKV activity of previously known broad-spectrum antiviral compounds and discovered several compounds (e.g., NITD008, SaliPhe, and CID 91632869) with anti-ZIKV activity. Interestingly, while GTP synthesis inhibitors (e.g., ribavirin or mycophenolic acid) were too toxic or showed no anti-ZIKV activity (EC 50 {$>$}50{$\mu$}M), ZIKV was highly susceptible to pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors (e.g., brequinar) in the assay.  We amended the assay into a high-throughput screen (HTS)-compatible 384-well format and then screened the NIH Clinical Compound Collection library, which includes a total of 727 compounds organized, using an 8-point dose response format with two Zika virus strains (MR766 and PRVABC59, a recent human isolate). The screen discovered 6-azauridine and finasteride as potential anti-ZIKV inhibitors with EC 50  levels of 3.18 and 9.85{$\mu$}M for MR766, respectively. We further characterized the anti-ZIKV activity of 6-azauridine and several pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors such as brequinar in various secondary assays including an antiviral spectrum test within flaviviruses and alphaviruses, Western blot (protein), real-time PCR (RNA), and plaque reduction assays (progeny virus). From these assays, we discovered that brequinar has potent anti-ZIKV activity. Our results show that a broad anti-ZIKV screen of compound libraries with our CPE-based HTS assay will reveal multiple chemotypes that could be pursued as lead compounds for therapies to treat ZIKV-associated diseases or as molecular probes to study the biology of the ZIKV replication mechanism.},

This review seeks to gather and assess the contributions of translational research associated with Zika virus infection, including maternal-fetal vertical transmission of the virus. Nearly 200 inhibitors that have been evaluated in vivo and/or in vitro for their therapeutic properties against the Zika virus are summarized in this review. We also review the status of current vaccine candidates.

Between 2000 and 2021, several arbovirus outbreaks were recorded in African countries, including dengue, yellow fever, Chikungunya, Zika, and O'nyong nyong. Most often, the causes and factors involved in these outbreaks are unknown. We aimed to understand current knowledge regarding factors responsible for the persistent transmission and emergence of mosquito-borne arboviruses in Africa and to identify critical research gaps important for preventing future outbreaks. We used a systematic literature review between 2020 and 2021, to show that the main identified factors favoring the arbovirus outbreak in Africa are low vaccination coverage, high density and diversity of competent mosquitoes, insecticide resistance of mosquito vectors, and a scarcity of data on arboviruses. Further studies on arboviruses may include studies of competence to viral strains and the susceptibility of mosquito vectors to insecticides. Because of the detrimental effects of insecticides on human health and the environment, viral paratransgenesis and other biological control methods should be explored as alternatives or as supplements to insecticides.},

These small RNAs have been named microRNAs, and they have an important impact on viral infections.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Viral-host protein-protein interaction plays a vital role in pathogenesis, since it defines viral infection of the host and regulation of the host proteins. Identification of key viral-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has great implication for therapeutics. METHODS: In this study, a systematic attempt has been made to predict viral-host PPIs by integrating different features, including domain-domain association, network topology and sequence information using viral-host PPIs from VirusMINT. The three well-known supervised machine learning methods, such as SVM, Na\"ive Bayes and Random Forest, which are commonly used in the prediction of PPIs, were employed to evaluate the performance measure based on five-fold cross validation techniques. RESULTS: Out of 44 descriptors, best features were found to be domain-domain association and methionine, serine and valine amino acid composition of viral proteins. In this study, SVM-based method achieved better sensitivity of 67\% over Na\"ive Bayes (37.49\%) and Random Forest (55.66\%). However the specificity of Na\"ive Bayes was the highest (99.52\%) as compared with SVM (74\%) and Random Forest (89.08\%). Overall, the SVM and Random Forest achieved accuracy of 71\% and 72.41\%, respectively. The proposed SVM-based method was evaluated on blind dataset and attained a sensitivity of 64\%, specificity of 83\%, and accuracy of 74\%. In addition, unknown potential targets of hepatitis B virus-human and hepatitis E virus-human PPIs have been predicted through proposed SVM model and validated by gene ontology enrichment analysis. Our proposed model shows that, hepatitis B virus "C protein" binds to membrane docking protein, while "X protein" and "P protein" interacts with cell-killing and metabolic process proteins, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can predict large scale interspecies viral-human PPIs. The nature and function of unknown viral proteins (HBV and HEV), interacting partners of host protein were identified using optimised SVM model.},

More than 20 out of 774 tested compounds decreased ZIKV infection in our invitro screening assay. Selected compounds were further validated for inhibition of ZIKV infection in human cervical, placental, and neural stem cell lines, as well as primary human amnion cells. Established anti-flaviviral drugs (e.g., bortezomib and mycophenolic acid) and others that had no previously known antiviral activity (e.g., daptomycin) were identified as inhibitors of ZIKV infection. Several drugs reduced ZIKV infection across multiple cell types. This study identifies drugs that could be tested in clinical studies of ZIKV infection and provides a resource of small molecules to study ZIKV pathogenesis.},

Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, which is widely used in drug discovery, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on a QC. Here, we show how to achieve compression with data sets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands of molecules (whole cell screening data sets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and the data reuploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches.

More recently, ZIKV has undergone rapid geographic expansion and has been responsible for outbreaks in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and America. In this review, we have highlighted the influence of viral genetic variants on ZIKV pathogenesis. Two major ZIKV genotypes (African and Asian) have been identified. The Asian genotype is subdivided into Southwest Asia, Pacific Island, and American strains, and is responsible for most outbreaks. Non-synonymous mutations in ZIKV proteins C, prM, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, and NS4B were found to have a higher prevalence and association with virulent strains of the Asian genotype. Consequently, the Asian genotype appears to have acquired higher cellular permissiveness, tissue persistence, and viral tropism in human neural cells. Therefore, mutations in specific coding regions of the Asian genotype may enhance ZIKV infectivity. Considering that mutations in the genomes of emerging viruses may lead to new virulent variants in humans, there is a potential for the re-emergence of new ZIKV cases in the future.},

Due to a large number of worldwide outbreaks and associated neurological complications with ZIKV, a public health emergency was declared by the World Health Organization on February 1, 2016. The virus exhibits neurotropism and has a specific propensity towards neural precursor cells of the developing brain. In utero ZIKV infection causes massive cell death in the developing brain resulting in various motor and cognitive disabilities in newborns. The virus modulates cell machinery at several levels to replicate itself and inhibits toll like receptors-3 signalling, deregulates microRNA circuitry and induces a chronic inflammatory response in affected cells. Several significant advances have been made to understand the mechanisms of neuropathogenesis, its prevention and treatment. The current review provides an update on cellular and molecular mechanisms of ZIKV-induced alterations in the function of various brain cells.},

New daunting evidence suggests that a single mutation in Zika virus genome may increase transmission and pathogenesis, further highlighting the need to be prepared for flavivirus outbreaks. Dengue, in particular infects about 400 million people each year, leading to reoccurring local outbreaks. Public health efforts to mitigate flavivirus transmission is largely dependent on vector control strategies, as only a limited number of flavivirus vaccines have been developed thus far. There are currently no commercially available antivirals for flaviviruses, leaving supportive care as the primary treatment option. In this review, we will briefly paint a broad picture of the flavivirus landscape in terms of therapeutics, with particular focus on viral targets, promising novel compounds entering the drug discovery pipeline, as well as model systems for evaluating drug efficacy.},

  abstract = {The flavivirus genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor requiring multiple cleavages by host and viral proteases in order to produce the individual proteins that constitute an infectious virion. Previous studies have revealed that the NS2B cofactor of the viral NS2B-NS3 heterocomplex protease displays a conformational dynamic between active and inactive states. Here, we developed a conformational switch assay based on split luciferase complementation (SLC) to monitor the conformational change of NS2B and to characterize candidate allosteric inhibitors. Binding of an active-site inhibitor to the protease resulted in a conformational change of NS2B and led to significant SLC enhancement. Mutagenesis of key residues at an allosteric site abolished this induced conformational change and SLC enhancement. We also performed a virtual screen of NCI library compounds to identify allosteric inhibitors, followed by in vitro biochemical screening of the resultant candidates. Only three of these compounds, NSC135618, 260594, and 146771, significantly inhibited the protease of Dengue virus 2 (DENV2) in vitro, with IC50 values of 1.8 {$\mu$}M, 11.4 {$\mu$}M, and 4.8 {$\mu$}M, respectively. Among the three compounds, only NSC135618 significantly suppressed the SLC enhancement triggered by binding of active-site inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that it inhibits the conformational change of NS2B. Results from virus titer reduction assays revealed that NSC135618 is a broad spectrum flavivirus protease inhibitor, and can significantly reduce titers of DENV2, Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Yellow fever virus (YFV) on A549 cells in vivo, with EC50 values in low micromolar range. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of NSC135618 is only moderate with CC50 of 48.8 {$\mu$}M on A549 cells. Moreover, NSC135618 inhibited ZIKV in human placental and neural progenitor cells relevant to ZIKV pathogenesis. Results from binding, kinetics, Western blot, mass spectrometry and mutagenesis experiments unambiguously demonstrated an allosteric mechanism for inhibition of the viral protease by NSC135618.},

  abstract = {Zika fever is an infectious disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). The disease is claiming millions of lives worldwide, primarily in developing countries. In addition to vector control strategies, the most effective way to prevent the spread of ZIKV infection is vaccination. There is no clinically approved vaccine to combat ZIKV infection and curb its pandemic. An epitope-based peptide vaccine (EBPV) is seen as a powerful alternative to conventional vaccinations because of its low production cost and short production time. Nonetheless, EBPVs have gotten less attention, despite the fact that they have a significant untapped potential for enhancing vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and cross-reactivity. Such a vaccine technology is based on target pathogen's selected antigenic peptides called T-cell epitopes (TCE), which are synthesized chemically based on their amino acid sequences. The identification of TCEs using wet-lab experimental approach is challenging, expensive, and time-consuming. Therefore in this study, we present computational model for the prediction of ZIKV TCEs. The model proposed is an ensemble of decision trees that utilizes the physicochemical properties of amino acids. In this way a large amount of time and efforts would be saved for quick vaccine development. The peptide sequences dataset for model training was retrieved from Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. The sequences dataset consist of experimentally verified T-cell epitopes (TCEs) and non-TCEs. The model demonstrated promising results when evaluated on test dataset. The evaluation metrics namely, accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, Gini and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) recorded values of 0.9789, 0.984, 0.981, 0.987, 0.974 and 0.948 respectively. The consistency and reliability of the model was assessed by carrying out the five (05)-fold cross-validation technique, and the mean accuracy of 0.97864 was reported. Finally, model was compared with standard machine learning (ML) algorithms and the proposed model outperformed all of them. The proposed model will aid in predicting novel and immunodominant TCEs of ZIKV. The predicted TCEs may have a high possibility of acting as prospective vaccine targets subjected to in-vivo and in-vitro scientific assessments, thereby saving lives worldwide, preventing future epidemic-scale outbreaks, and lowering the possibility of mutation escape.},

Currently, there is no approved vaccine for clinical use to combat the Zika Virus infection and its epidemic. The in-silico approach to T-cell epitope prediction of Zika virus is useful to save biologist's time and efforts for vaccine development. The authors have proposed a novel ensemble machine learning model to predict Zika virus T\textendash cell epitopes using physicochemical properties of amino acids. The model has been designed by fusing the top two performing classifiers from among the six machine learning classifiers (base classifiers). The peptide sequences consisting of experimentally determined T-cell epitopes and non-epitopes of Zika virus were collected from Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB). The authors have verified the model through Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 92.11\% on the test dataset. We validated the model using a separate validation set and the model achieved an accuracy of 93.47\%, Gini of 0.968, AUC of 0.996, the sensitivity of 0.964, and specificity of 0.961. To check the robustness of the model, a technique called repeated k-fold cross-validation was used, and an average accuracy of 91.7\% was recorded.

  abstract = {Summary  Background  The incidence of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015 was 20 times higher than in previous years. Congenital microcephaly is associated with genetic factors and several causative agents. Epidemiological data suggest that microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika virus. We aimed to detect and sequence the Zika virus genome in amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly.  Methods  In this case study, amniotic fluid samples from two pregnant women from the state of Paraiba in Brazil whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly were obtained, on the recommendation of the Brazilian health authorities, by ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis at 28 weeks' gestation. The women had presented at 18 weeks' and 10 weeks' gestation, respectively, with clinical manifestations that could have been symptoms of Zika virus infection, including fever, myalgia, and rash. After the amniotic fluid samples were centrifuged, DNA and RNA were extracted from the purified virus particles before the viral genome was identified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic reconstruction and investigation of recombination events were done by comparing the Brazilian Zika virus genome with sequences from other Zika strains and from flaviviruses that occur in similar regions in Brazil.  Findings  We detected the Zika virus genome in the amniotic fluid of both pregnant women. The virus was not detected in their urine or serum. Tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus,  Toxoplasma gondii , rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV,  Treponema pallidum , and parvovirus B19 were all negative. After sequencing of the complete genome of the Brazilian Zika virus isolated from patient 1, phylogenetic analyses showed that the virus shares 97\textendash 100\% of its genomic identity with lineages isolated during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, and that in both envelope and NS5 genomic regions, it clustered with sequences from North and South America, southeast Asia, and the Pacific. After assessing the possibility of recombination events between the Zika virus and other flaviviruses, we ruled out the hypothesis that the Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant strain with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses.  Interpretation  These findings strengthen the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in neonates in Brazil. Moreover, our results suggest that the virus can cross the placental barrier. As a result, Zika virus should be considered as a potential infectious agent for human fetuses. Pathogenesis studies that confirm the tropism of Zika virus for neuronal cells are warranted.

  abstract = {To the Editor: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus related to yellow fever virus, dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV). It is a single-stranded positive RNA virus (10,794-nt genome) that is closely related to the Spondweni virus and is transmitted by many Aedes spp. mosquitoes, including Ae. africanus, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. hensilli, and Ae. aegypti. The virus was identified in rhesus monkeys during sylvatic yellow fever surveillance in the Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947 and was reported in humans in 1952 (1). In 2007, an outbreak of ZIKV was reported in Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia (2). ZIKV also caused a major epidemic in the French Polynesia in 2013\textendash 2014 (3), and New Caledonia reported imported cases from French Polynesia in 2013 and reported an outbreak in 2014 (4). A new challenge has arisen in Brazil with the emergence of ZIKV and co-circulation with others arboviruses (i.e., DENV and chikungunya virus [CHIKV]). We report ZIKV infection in Brazil associated with a recent ongoing outbreak in Camacari, Bahia, Brazil, of an illness characterized by maculopapular rash, fever, myalgias/arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. On March 26, 2015, serum samples were obtained from 24 patients (Table) at Santa Helena Hospital in Camacari who were given a presumptive diagnosis of an acute viral illness by emergency department physicians. These patients were given treatment for a dengue-like illness, and blood samples were obtained for complete blood counts and serologic testing by using an ELISA specific for IgG and IgM against DENV. Serum samples were analyzed at the Federal University of Bahia by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect DENV, CHIKV, WNV, Mayaro virus, and ZIKV. In brief, serum samples were subjected to RNA extraction by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RNA was reverse transcribed by using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcription Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and subjected to PCRs specific for DENV (5) CHIKV (6), WNV (7) and Mayaro virus (8). A positive RT-PCR for a partial region of the envelope gene with primers ZIKVENF and ZIKVENVR (positions 1538\textendash 1558 and 1902\textendash 1883, respectively) (9) was considered indicative of ZIKV infection. PCR products (362 bp) were sequenced at the ACTGene Analises Moleculares, Alvorada, Rio Grande do Sul (Porto Allegre, Brazil), and sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession nos. \{"type":"entrez-nucleotide-range","attrs":\{"text":"KR816333-KR816336","start\_term":"KR816333","end\_term":"KR816336","start\_term\_id":"937547778","end\_term\_id":"937547784"\}\}KR816333-KR816336. All patients were negative by RT-PCR for DENV, Mayaro virus, and WNV. Samples from 7 (29.2\%) patients were positive by RT-PCR for ZIKV (369-bp fragment) and from 3 (12.5\%) patients for CHIKV (305-bp fragment). There was no simultaneous detection of ZIKV and CHIKV. Most (85.7\%) patients positive for ZIKV were women; they had a median age of 28 years and no history of international travel. Patients positive for ZIKV sought medical care after a 4-day (range 1\textendash 5 days) history of rash, myalgias, arthralgias, or fever. Three patients had IgG against DENV, which is consistent with a previous DENV infection, and none of the 7 ZIKV-positive patients had a positive response for DENV. Mean laboratory findings for patients with acute ZIKV infection were a leukocyte count of 3,750 cells/mm3 (range 2,790 cells/mm3\textendash 6,150 cells/mm3) and a platelet count of 180,000 platelets/mm3 (range 151,000 platelets/mm3\textendash 274,000 platelets/mm3). The mean C-reactive protein level was 16.3 mg/L (range 0.9 mg/L\textendash 19.7 mg/L). Sign and symptom duration was 1\textendash 5 days, and most patients had a maculopapular rash, myalgias, fever, and headache. Arthralgia was seen less frequently. ZIKV infections were assessed by sequencing partial ZIKV envelope gene regions of isolates. Phylogenetic analysis rooted with Spondwei virus showed that ZIKV sequences obtained belonged to the Asian lineage and showed 99\% identity with a sequence from a ZIKV isolate from French Polynesia (\{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":\{"text":"KJ776791","term\_id":"1061065316","term\_text":"KJ776791"\}\}KJ776791) (10). We report ZIKV infection in Brazil in association with an ongoing outbreak of an acute maculoexantematic illness. Although the patient population samples were not randomly selected, 42\% (10/24) of the patients were positive for ZIKV (n = 7) or CHIKV (n = 3) and had maculopapular rash, fever, myalgias and headache. After detection of ZIKV in Bahia, many cases have been identified in other states (http://www.promedmail.org, archive no. 20152015602.343.1158). Cases of infection with DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in Brazil and elsewhere will make diagnosis based on clinical and epidemiologic grounds unreliable. These issues show the need for laboratory confirmation of these arboviral infections. More studies are needed to address the effects of these concurrent arboviruses infections in Brazil.

During the same period, an increase in Guillain-Barre syndrome was reported, suggesting a possible association between Zika virus and Guillain-Barre syndrome. We aimed to assess the role of Zika virus and dengue virus infection in developing Guillain-Barre syndrome.  Methods  In this case-control study, cases were patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome diagnosed at the Centre Hospitalier de Polynesie Francaise (Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia) during the outbreak period. Controls were age-matched, sex-matched, and residence-matched patients who presented at the hospital with a non-febrile illness (control group 1; n=98) and age-matched patients with acute Zika virus disease and no neurological symptoms (control group 2; n=70). Virological investigations included RT-PCR for Zika virus, and both microsphere immunofluorescent and seroneutralisation assays for Zika virus and dengue virus. Anti-glycolipid reactivity was studied in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome using both ELISA and combinatorial microarrays.  Findings  42 patients were diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome during the study period. 41 (98\%) patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome had anti-Zika virus IgM or IgG, and all (100\%) had neutralising antibodies against Zika virus compared with 54 (56\%) of 98 in control group 1 (p  Interpretation  This is the first study providing evidence for Zika virus infection causing Guillain-Barre syndrome.

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-born virus that is mainly transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes spp. Since its first isolation in 1947, only a few human cases had been described until large outbreaks occurred on Yap Island (2007), French Polynesia (2013), and Brazil (2015). Most ZIKV-infected individuals are asymptomatic or present with a self-limiting disease and nonspecific symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and headache. However, in French Polynesia and Brazil, ZIKV outbreaks led to the diagnosis of congenital malformations and microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barr\'e syndrome (GBS) in adults. These new clinical presentations raised concern from public health authorities and highlighted the need for anti-Zika treatments and vaccines to control the neurological damage caused by the virus. Despite many efforts in the search for an effective treatment, neither vaccines nor antiviral drugs have become available to control ZIKV infection and/or replication. Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds that are well-known for possessing several biological properties, have shown activity against different viruses. Additionally, the use of flavonoids in some countries as food supplements indicates that these molecules are nontoxic to humans. Thus, here, we summarize knowledge on the use of flavonoids as a source of anti-ZIKV molecules and discuss the gaps and challenges in this area before these compounds can be considered for further preclinical and clinical trials.},

On Feb 1, 2016, WHO declared the suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This association, however, has not been precisely quantified.  Methods  We retrospectively analysed data from a Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, which was the largest documented outbreak before that in the Americas. We used serological and surveillance data to estimate the probability of infection with Zika virus for each week of the epidemic and searched medical records to identify all cases of microcephaly from September, 2013, to July, 2015. Simple models were used to assess periods of risk in pregnancy when Zika virus might increase the risk of microcephaly and estimate the associated risk.  Findings  The Zika virus outbreak began in October, 2013, and ended in April, 2014, and 66\% (95\% CI 62\textendash 70) of the general population were infected. Of the eight microcephaly cases identified during the 23-month study period, seven (88\%) occurred in the 4-month period March 1 to July 10, 2014. The timing of these cases was best explained by a period of risk in the first trimester of pregnancy. In this model, the baseline prevalence of microcephaly was two cases (95\% CI 0\textendash 8) per 10000 neonates, and the risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection was 95 cases (34\textendash 191) per 10000 women infected in the first trimester. We could not rule out an increased risk of microcephaly from infection in other trimesters, but models that excluded the first trimester were not supported by the data.  Interpretation  Our findings provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of microcephaly in fetuses and neonates whose mothers are infected with Zika virus.

  abstract = {From many decades, emerging infections have threatened humanity. The pandemics caused by different CoVs have already claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The SARS, Ebola, MERS epidemics and the most recent emergence of COVID-19 pandemic have threatened populations across borders. Since a highly pathogenic CoV has been evolved into the human population in the twenty-first century known as SARS, scientific advancements and innovative methods to tackle these viruses have increased in order to improve response preparedness towards the unpredictable threat posed by these rapidly emerging pathogens. Recently published review articles on SARS-CoV-2 have mainly focused on its pathogenesis, epidemiology and available treatments. However, in this review, we have done a systematic comparison of all three CoVs i.e., SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 along with Ebola and Zika in terms of their epidemiology, virology, clinical features and current treatment strategies. This review focuses on important emerging RNA viruses starting from Zika, Ebola and the CoVs which include SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. Each of these viruses has been elaborated on the basis of their epidemiology, virulence, transmission and treatment. However, special attention has been given to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by it i.e., COVID-19 due to current havoc caused worldwide. At the end, insights into the current understanding of the lessons learned from previous epidemics to combat emerging CoVs have been described. The travel-related viral spread, the unprecedented nosocomial outbreaks and the high case-fatality rates associated with these highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses highlight the need for new prophylactic and therapeutic actions which include but are not limited to clinical indicators, contact tracing, and laboratory investigations as important factors that need to be taken into account in order to arrive at the final conclusion.,                                        \textbullet{}               Recently published review articles on SARS-CoV-2 have mainly focused on its pathogenesis, epidemiology and available treatments.                                         \textbullet{}               The pandemics caused by different CoVs have already claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives.                                         \textbullet{}               This review focuses on important emerging RNA viruses starting from Zika, Ebola and the CoVs which include SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2.                                         \textbullet{}               Globally, numerous studies and researchers have recently started fighting this virus.},

There are currently limited anti-ZIKV treatment options that are readily available and safe for use in pregnancy. In this drug repurposing study, bromocriptine was found to have inhibitory effects on ZIKV replication in cytopathic effect inhibition, virus yield reduction, and plaque reduction assays. Time-of-drug-addition assay showed that bromocriptine exerted anti-ZIKV activity between 0 and 12h post-ZIKV inoculation, corroborating with post-entry events in the virus replication cycle prior to budding. Our docking model showed that bromocriptine interacted with several active site residues of the proteolytic cavity involving H51 and S135 in the ZIKV-NS2B-NS3 protease protein, and might occupy the active site and inhibit the protease activity of the ZIKV-NS2B-NS3 protein. A fluorescence-based protease inhibition assay confirmed that bromocriptine inhibited ZIKV protease activity. Moreover, bromocriptine exhibited synergistic effect with interferon-{$\alpha$}2b against ZIKV replication in cytopathic effect inhibition assay. The availability of per vagina administration of bromocriptine as suppositories or vaginoadhesive discs and the synergistic anti-ZIKV activity between bromocriptine and type I interferon may make bromocriptine a potentially useful and readily available treatment option for ZIKV infection. The anti-ZIKV effects of bromocriptine should be evaluated in a suitable animal model.},

Finally, posaconazole (POS) was confirmed to effectively inhibit both RdRp activity with an IC50 of 4.29 {$\mu$}M and the ZIKV replication with an EC50 of 0.59 {$\mu$}M. Moreover, POS was shown to reduce RdRp activity by binding with the key amino acid D666 through molecular docking and site-directed mutation analysis.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women with Zika virus infection who completed pregnancy in New York City from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017. Confirmed Zika virus infection was defined as 1) nucleic acid amplification test-detected Zika virus, or 2) a nonnegative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test result and a plaque-reduction neutralization test result positive for Zika virus but negative for dengue virus, or 3) delivery of a neonate with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection. Probable infection was defined as a nonnegative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test result and a positive plaque-reduction neutralization test result for Zika virus and dengue virus. RESULTS: We identified 390 women with confirmed (28\%) or probable (72\%) Zika virus infection. Fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis was reported by 31\% of women and were more common among women with confirmed than with probable infection (43\% vs 26\%, P=.001). Of 366 neonates born to these women, 295 (81\%) were tested for Zika virus and 22 (7\%) had laboratory-diagnosed congenital Zika virus infection. The relative risk (RR) for having a neonate with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection was greater among women with fever (RR 4.8, 95\% CI 2.1-10.7), tingling (RR 4.8, CI 1.7-13.7), or numbness (RR 6.9, CI 2.6-18.2) during pregnancy or the periconception period. However, the RR did not differ whether the mother had confirmed or probable Zika virus infection (RR 1.6, CI 0.7-4.1). CONCLUSION: In New York City, a greater proportion of women had probable Zika virus infection than confirmed infection. Women with some symptoms during pregnancy or periconceptionally were more likely to have a neonate with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection. Neonates born to women with confirmed or probable Zika virus infection should be tested for Zika virus infection.},

  abstract = {The Flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) is the causal agent of neurological disorders like microcephaly in newborns or Guillain-Barre syndrome. Its NS5 protein embeds a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in the formation of the viral mRNA cap. We investigated the structural and functional properties of the ZIKV MTase. We show that the ZIKV MTase can methylate RNA cap structures at the N-7 position of the cap, and at the 2'-O position on the ribose of the first nucleotide, yielding a cap-1 structure. In addition, the ZIKV MTase methylates the ribose 2'-O position of internal adenosines of RNA substrates. The crystal structure of the ZIKV MTase determined at a 2.01-A resolution reveals a crystallographic homodimer. One chain is bound to the methyl donor (S-adenosyl-l-methionine [SAM]) and shows a high structural similarity to the dengue virus (DENV) MTase. The second chain lacks SAM and displays conformational changes in the {$\alpha$}X {$\alpha$}-helix contributing to the SAM and RNA binding. These conformational modifications reveal a possible molecular mechanism of the enzymatic turnover involving a conserved Ser/Arg motif. In the second chain, the SAM binding site accommodates a sulfate close to a glycerol that could serve as a basis for structure-based drug design. In addition, compounds known to inhibit the DENV MTase show similar inhibition potency on the ZIKV MTase. Altogether these results contribute to a better understanding of the ZIKV MTase, a central player in viral replication and host innate immune response, and lay the basis for the development of potential antiviral drugs.IMPORTANCE The Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with microcephaly in newborns, and other neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. It is urgent to develop antiviral strategies inhibiting the viral replication. The ZIKV NS5 embeds a methyltransferase involved in the viral mRNA capping process, which is essential for viral replication and control of virus detection by innate immune mechanisms. We demonstrate that the ZIKV methyltransferase methylates the mRNA cap and adenosines located in RNA sequences. The structure of ZIKV methyltransferase shows high structural similarities to the dengue virus methyltransferase, but conformational specificities highlight the role of a conserved Ser/Arg motif, which participates in RNA and SAM recognition during the reaction turnover. In addition, the SAM binding site accommodates a sulfate and a glycerol, offering structural information to initiate structure-based drug design. Altogether, these results contribute to a better understanding of the Flavivirus methyltransferases, which are central players in the virus replication.},

  abstract = {Background Zika virus is an emerging crisis as infection is implicated in severe neurological disorders\textemdash Guillain\textendash Barr\'e syndrome and fetal microcephaly. There are currently no treatment options available for Zika virus infection. This virus is part of the flavivirus genus and closely related to Dengue Fever Virus, West Nile Virus, and Japanese Encephalitis Virus. Like other flaviviruses, the Zika virus genome encodes three structural proteins (capsid, precursor membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Currently, no structural information exists on these viral proteins to facilitate vaccine design and rational drug discovery. Methods Structures for all Zika virus viral proteins were predicted using experimental templates available from closely related viruses using the online SwissModel server. These homology models were compared to drug targets from other viruses using Visual Molecular Dynamics Multiseq software. Sequential alignment of all Zika virus polyproteins was performed using Clustal Omega to identify mutations in specific viral proteins implicated in pathogenesis. Results The precursor membrane, envelope, and NS1 proteins are unique to Zika virus highlighting possible challenges in vaccine design. Sequential differences between Zika virus strains occur at critical positions on precursor membrane, envelope, NS2A, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 as potential loci for differential pathogenesis. Druggable pockets in Dengue Fever Virus and West Nile Virus NS3 and NS5 are retained in predicted Zika virus structures. Conclusions Lead candidates for Zika virus can likely be established using NS3 and NS5 inhibitors from other flaviviruses, and the structures presented can provide opportunities for Zika virus intervention strategies.},

Here Alysson Muotri and colleagues show that the Brazilian Zika virus strain can cross the placenta and cause intrauterine growth restriction, including signs of microcephaly, in the SJL strain of mice. They also show that the virus can infect human brain organoids, inducing cell death by apoptosis and disrupting cortical layers. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) and was first described in 1947 in Uganda following blood analyses of sentinel Rhesus monkeys1. Until the twentieth century, the African and Asian lineages of the virus did not cause meaningful infections in humans. However, in 2007, vectored by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, ZIKV caused the first noteworthy epidemic on the Yap Island in Micronesia2. Patients experienced fever, skin rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis2. From 2013 to 2015, the Asian lineage of the virus caused further massive outbreaks in New Caledonia and French Polynesia. In 2013, ZIKV reached Brazil, later spreading to other countries in South and Central America3. In Brazil, the virus has been linked to congenital malformations, including microcephaly and other severe neurological diseases, such as Guillain\textendash Barre syndrome4,5. Despite clinical evidence, direct experimental proof showing that the Brazilian ZIKV (ZIKVBR) strain causes birth defects remains absent6. Here we demonstrate that ZIKVBR infects fetuses, causing intrauterine growth restriction, including signs of microcephaly, in mice. Moreover, the virus infects human cortical progenitor cells, leading to an increase in cell death. We also report that the infection of human brain organoids results in a reduction of proliferative zones and disrupted cortical layers. These results indicate that ZIKVBR crosses the placenta and causes microcephaly by targeting cortical progenitor cells, inducing cell death by apoptosis and autophagy, and impairing neurodevelopment. Our data reinforce the growing body of evidence linking the ZIKVBR outbreak to the alarming number of cases of congenital brain malformations. Our model can be used to determine the efficiency of therapeutic approaches to counteracting the harmful impact of ZIKVBR in human neurodevelopment.},

The global pandemic of ZIKV in 2015 prompted concern among scientific community. Zika is a flavivirus of the family \emph{Flaviviridae} transmitted by mosquitoes. Natural vertical transmission is an ecological strategy that arboviruses adopt to ensure their survival inside the mosquito vector during harsh conditions or interepidemic periods when horizontal transmission is difficult. ZIKV is vertically transmitted from infected females to its offspring. This review has concluded various studies regarding the vertical transmission ability of different mosquito species for ZIKV. Previously \emph{Aedes aegypti} was considered to be a major vector, however \emph{Aedes albopictus} and \emph{Culex quinquifasciatus} are discovered to have the similar vertical transmission potential. Different studies shown that natural vertical transmission has been detected in mosquito species which are not implicated as possible vectors. It leads to the possibility that many other mosquito species may be potential ZIKV vectors.{$<$}br{$>$}},

Arboviruses are a significant NTD category spread by mosquitoes. Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika are three arboviruses that affect a large proportion of the population in Latin and South America. The clinical diagnosis of these arboviral diseases is a difficult task due to the concurrent circulation of several arboviruses which present similar symptoms and, sometimes, inaccurate test results. In this paper, we present the state of the art of studies investigating the automatic classification of arboviral diseases based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Results show that current research is focused on the classification of Dengue, primarily using tree-based ML algorithms. The use of an efficient clinical decision support system for arboviral diseases can improve the quality of the entire clinical process, thus increasing the accuracy of the diagnosis and the associated treatment. It should help physicians in their decision-making process and, consequently, improve the use of resources and the patient's quality of life.},

The virus is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes mosquitos, mainly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. ZIKV has been detected for decades in African and Asian regions and, since 2007, has spread to other continents; among them, infections are most reported in the Americas. This can be explained by the presence of vectors in highly populated and tropical regions where people are susceptible to contamination. ZIKV has been considered by the World Health Organization a serious public health problem because of the increasing number of cases of congenital malformation and neurological disorders related to its infection, such as microcephaly, Guillain\textendash Barre syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and myelitis. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral against ZIKV. The infection is best prevented by avoiding mosquito bite, and the treatment of infected patients is palliative. In this context, the search for efficient antivirals is necessary but remains challenging. Here, we aim to review the molecules that have been described to interfere with ZIKV life cycle and discuss their potential use in ZIKV therapy.},

  abstract = {Arthropod-borne viruses, also known as arboviruses, are transmitted by bites of infected mosquito or tick vectors. In this context, the Flavivirus genus is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus, being the Ae. africanus, Ae. aegypti, and Ae. Albopictus species are responsible for transmitting the Zika virus (ZIKV). It is a lipid-enveloped virus constitute of an RNA genome, which is translated into a polyprotein encoding three structural proteins \{(capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelope (E)\} and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Several biological targets have been identified for developing antiviral agents against ZIKV, which could prevent virus entry, assembly, or release of new virion particles, by interactions with structural proteins. Drugs targeting non-structural proteins could inhibit the ZIKV-replication cycle. Nature has provided excellent compounds for designing new potent analogs. The medicinal chemistry emerges as an impressive, rationally design and to develop new antiviral agents. Additionally, virtual and high-throughput screenings have contributed greatly to the identification of previously approved-drugs that could be repurposed for ZIKV, as antiviral agents. In this chapter, we offer a literature review about the most relevant and recent advances made on the medicinal chemistry of ZIKV research. We focus on natural, nature-based, semi-synthetic, and synthetic antiviral compounds, as well as repurposed drugs and other inhibitors targeting ZIKV.},

In adults, cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and meningoencephalitis associated with ZIKV infection have been reported, but to date, no specific therapy is available. There is an urgency for the discovery of antiviral agents capable of inhibiting viral replication and its deleterious effects. Chloroquine is widely used as an antimalarial drug and anti-inflammatory agent that also shows antiviral activity against several viruses. Here we show that chloroquine exhibits antiviral activity against ZIKV in VERO, human brain microvascular endothelial, and neural stem cells. We demonstrated in vitro that chloroquine reduces the number of ZIKV-infected cells, virus production and cell death promoted by ZIKV infection without cytotoxic effects. Our results suggest that chloroquine is a promising candidate for ZIKV clinical trials, since it is already approved for clinical use and can be safely administered to pregnant woman.},

  abstract = {Flaviviruses are the fastest spreading arthropod-borne viruses that cause severe symptoms such as hepatitis, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and congenital deformities. Nearly 40 \% of the entire human population is at risk of flavivirus epidemics. Yet, effective vaccination is restricted only to a few flaviviruses such as yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses, and most recently for select cases of dengue virus infections. Despite the global spread of dengue virus, and emergence of new threats such as Zika virus and a new genotype of Japanese encephalitis virus, insights into flavivirus targets for potentially broad-spectrum vaccination are limited. In this review article, we highlight biochemical and structural differences in flavivirus proteins critical for virus assembly and host interactions. A comparative sequence analysis of pH-responsive properties of viral structural proteins identifies trends in conservation of complementary acidic-basic character between interacting viral structural proteins. This is highly relevant to the understanding of pH-sensitive differences in virus assembly in organelles such as neutral ER and acidic Golgi. Surface residues in viral interfaces identified by structural approaches are shown to demonstrate partial conservation, further reinforcing virus-specificity in assembly and interactions with host proteins. A comparative analysis of epitope conservation in emerging flaviviruses identifies therapeutic antibody candidates that have potential as broad spectrum anti-virals, thus providing a path towards development of vaccines.},

(5) Monkeys develop an inapparent infection after subcutaneous inoculation with mouse brain virus. After intracerebral inoculation one of five monkeys showed a mild pyrexia, the others showed no signs of infection. Viraemia during the first week after inoculation has been found in all monkeys tested and antibody has been demonstrated by the 14th day after inoculation. 6.

ZIKV was first isolated from a nonhuman primate in 1947 and from mosquitoes in 1948 in Africa, and ZIKV infections in humans were sporadic for half a century before emerging in the Pacific and the Americas. ZIKV is usually transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The clinical presentation of Zika fever is nonspecific and can be misdiagnosed as other infectious diseases, especially those due to arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya. ZIKV infection was associated with only mild illness prior to the large French Polynesian outbreak in 2013 and 2014, when severe neurological complications were reported, and the emergence in Brazil of a dramatic increase in severe congenital malformations (microcephaly) suspected to be associated with ZIKV. Laboratory diagnosis of Zika fever relies on virus isolation or detection of ZIKV-specific RNA. Serological diagnosis is complicated by cross-reactivity among members of the Flavivirus genus. The adaptation of ZIKV to an urban cycle involving humans and domestic mosquito vectors in tropical areas where dengue is endemic suggests that the incidence of ZIKV infections may be underestimated. There is a high potential for ZIKV emergence in urban centers in the tropics that are infested with competent mosquito vectors such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus .},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Viral diseases are responsible for several deaths around the world. Over the past few years, the world has seen several outbreaks caused by viral diseases that, for a long time, seemed to possess no risk. These are diseases that have been forgotten for a long time and, until nowadays, there are no approved drugs or vaccines, leading the pharmaceutical industry and several research groups to run out of time in the search for new pharmacological treatments or prevention methods. In this context, drug repurposing proves to be a fast and economically viable technique, considering the fact that it uses drugs that have a well-established safety profile. Thus, in this review, we present the main advances in drug repurposing and their benefit for searching new treatments against emerging viral diseases. METHODS: We conducted a search in the bibliographic databases (Science Direct, Bentham Science, PubMed, Springer, ACS Publisher, Wiley, and NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio) using the keywords "drug repurposing", "emerging viral infections" and each of the diseases reported here (CoV; ZIKV; DENV; CHIKV; EBOV and MARV) as an inclusion/exclusion criterion. A subjective analysis was performed regarding the quality of the works for inclusion in this manuscript. Thus, the selected works were those that presented drugs repositioned against the emerging viral diseases presented here by means of computational, high-throughput screening or phenotype-based strategies, with no time limit and of relevant scientific value. RESULTS: 291 papers were selected, 24 of which were CHIKV; 52 for ZIKV; 43 for DENV; 35 for EBOV; 10 for MARV; and 56 for CoV and the rest (72 papers) related to the drugs repurposing and emerging viral diseases. Among CoV-related articles, most were published in 2020 (31 papers), updating the current topic. Besides, between the years 2003 - 2005, 10 articles were created, and from 2011 - 2015, there were 7 articles, portraying the outbreaks that occurred at that time. For ZIKV, similar to CoV, most publications were during the period of outbreaks between the years 2016 - 2017 (23 articles). Similarly, most CHIKV (13 papers) and DENV (14 papers) publications occur at the same time interval. For EBOV (13 papers) and MARV (4 papers), they were between the years 2015 - 2016. Through this review, several drugs were highlighted that can be evolved in vivo and clinical trials as possible used against these pathogens showed that remdesivir represent potential treatments against CoV. Furthermore, ribavirin may also be a potential treatment against CHIKV; sofosbuvir against ZIKV; celgosivir against DENV, and favipiravir against EBOV and MARV, representing new hopes against these pathogens. CONCLUSION: The conclusions of this review manuscript show the potential of the drug repurposing strategy in the discovery of new pharmaceutical products, as from this approach, drugs could be used against emerging viral diseases. Thus, this strategy deserves more attention among research groups and is a promising approach to the discovery of new drugs against emerging viral diseases and also other diseases.},

  abstract = {Although Flaviviruses such as dengue (DENV) and zika (ZIKV) virus are important human pathogens, an effective vaccine or antiviral treatment against them is not available. Hence, the search for new strategies to control flavivirus infections is essential. Several studies have shown that the host lipid metabolism could be an antiviral target because cholesterol and other lipids are required during the replicative cycle of different Flaviviridae family members. FDA-approved drugs with hypolipidemic effects could be an alternative for treating flavivirus infections. However, a better understanding of the regulation between host lipid metabolism and signaling pathways triggered during these infections is required. The metabolic pathways related to lipid metabolism modified during DENV and ZIKV infection are analyzed in this review. Additionally, the role of lipid-lowering drugs as safe host-targeted antivirals is discussed.},

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the flavivirus genus and is transmitted in Aedes mosquito vectors. Since its discovery in humans in 1952 in Uganda, ZIKV has been responsible for many outbreaks in South America, Africa, and Asia. Patients infected with ZIKV are usually asymptomatic; mild symptoms include fever, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue. However, severe infections may have neurological implications, such as Guillain-Barr\'e syndrome and fetal microcephaly. To date, there are no existing approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines against ZIKV infections; treatments mainly target the symptoms of infection. Preventive measures against mosquito breeding are the main strategy for limiting the spread of the virus. Antiviral drug research for the treatment of ZIKV infection has been rapidly developing, with many drug candidates emerging from drug repurposing studies, and compound screening. In particular, several studies have demonstrated the potential of natural products as antivirals for ZIKV infection. Hence, this paper will review recent advances in natural products in ZIKV antiviral drug discovery.},

However, the disease has been linked to neurological complications such as Guillain-Barr\'e syndrome and peripheral nerve involvement, and also to abortion and fetal deaths due to vertical transmission, resulting in various congenital malformations in newborns, including microcephaly. This review aimed to describe the o signs and symptoms that characterize the congenital Zika syndrome. Methods and findings A systematic review was performed with a protocol and described according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The search strategy yielded 2,048 studies. After the exclusion of duplicates and application of inclusion criteria, 46 studies were included. The main signs and symptoms associated with the congenital Zika syndrome were microcephaly, parenchymal or cerebellar calcifications, ventriculomegaly, central nervous system hypoplasia or atrophy, arthrogryposis, ocular findings in the posterior and anterior segments, abnormal visual function and low birthweight for gestational age. Conclusions Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a series of changes in the growth and development of children, while impacting the healthcare system due to the severity of cases. Our findings outline the disease profile in newborns and infants and may contribute to the development and updating of more specific clinical protocols.},

  abstract = {The increased mobility of goods, people, and animals worldwide has caused the spread of several arthropod vectors, leading to an increased risk of animal and human infections. Aedes koreicus is a common species in South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia. Due to its cold-resistant dormant eggs, the adults last from the late summer until the autumn seasons. For these reasons, it seems to be better adapted to colder temperatures, favoring its colonization of hilly and pre-alpine areas. Its first appearance in Europe was in 2008 in Belgium, where it is currently established. The species was subsequently detected in Italy in 2011, European Russia, Germany, the Swiss\textendash Italian border region, Hungary, Slovenia, Crimea, Austria, the Republic of Kazakhstan, and the Netherlands. The role of A. koreicus in the transmission of vector-borne pathogens remains unclear. The available scientific evidence is very old, often not available in English or not indexed in international databases, and therefore difficult to find. According to the literature reviewed, A. koreicus can be considered a new invasive mosquito species in Europe, establishing populations on the European continent. In addition, experimental evidence demonstrated its vector competence for both Dirofilaria immitis and Chikungunya and is relatively low for ZIKA but not for Western Nile Virus. On the other hand, even if the field evidence does not confirm the experimental findings, it is currently not possible to exclude with absolute certainty the potential involvement of this species in the spread, emergence, or re-emergence of these vector-borne disease agents.},

Infections in pregnant women are of major concern because of potential devastating consequences during pregnancy and have been associated with microcephaly in newborns. ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis. We discuss recent reports on the mechanisms used by ZIKV to replicate efficiently, and we highlight potential new areas of research for the development of therapeutic approaches.},

Moreover, few literature reviews have been conducted with these studies. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of ZIKV teratogenesis determined from studies in animal models. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus as well as grey literature were searched for studies that evaluated molecular alterations related to ZIKV teratogenesis which occurred during embryonic development. Nine studies were included: six with mice, one with mice and guinea pigs, one with pigs and one with chickens. In general, studies presented an unclear or high risk of bias for methodological criteria. Most of studies reported embryos exposed to ZIKV presenting microcephaly, reduced cortex thickness, and growth restriction. Different techniques were used to evaluated molecular changes in the animals following ZIKV infection: RNA sequencing, RT-qPCR, and in situ hybridization. It was found that common pathways are changed in most studies, being pathways related to immune response upregulated and those involved to neurodevelopment downregulated.},

Although the number of ZIKV cases in the Western Hemisphere have dropped since 2016, the need for basic research and anti-ZIKV drug development remains strong. Re-emerging viruses like ZIKV are an ever-present threat in the 21st century where fast transcontinental travel lends itself to viral epidemics.

Quite remarkably, a short, but intensive, drug-repurposing effort has already resulted in several readily available FDA-approved drugs that are capable of effectively combating the virus in infected adult mouse models and, most importantly, in both preventing maternal-fetal transmission and severe microcephaly in newborns in pregnant mouse models.},

Different sections reflect different points of congenital ZIKV infection syndrome: pathogenesis, prenatal diagnosis, clinical signs, neuroimaging and long-term developmental outcomes. It emerged that pathogenesis has not been fully clarified and that the clinical signs are not only limited to microcephaly. Given the current absence of treatments, we proposed schemes to optimize diagnostic protocols in endemic countries. It is essential to know the key aspects of this disease to guarantee early diagnosis, even in less severe cases, and an adequate management of the main chronic problems.

Variable selection algorithm coupled with random forests (VS-RF) is used to extract the physicochemical features most relevant to the RSV inhibition. Based on the selected small set of descriptors, four other widely used approaches, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process (GP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and k nearest neighbors (kNN) routines are also employed and compared with the VS-RF method in terms of several of rigorous evaluation criteria. The obtained results indicate that the VS-RF model is a powerful tool for classification of RSV inhibitors, producing the highest overall accuracy of 94.34\% for the external prediction set, which significantly outperforms the other four methods with the average accuracy of 80.66\%. The proposed model with excellent prediction capacity from internal to external quality should be important for screening and optimization of potential RSV inhibitors prior to chemical synthesis in drug development.},

We then focus on the ZIKV NS2B/NS3 protease, a major potential target for anti-ZIKV therapeutics. We describe the structure of the complex between Zika virus NS2B-NS3 protease and a peptide boronic-acid inhibitor that we determined in early 2016. We then review other structural studies on the Zika virus protease, which have been published in the past few months. Three different types of construct for the protease have been investigated by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy: the traditional ``linked'' construct comprising the NS2B cofactor, a Gly4SerGly4 linker, and the NS3pro chain; a construct where the linker has been replaced by Lys-Thr-Gly-Lys-Arg, which leads to autocleavage; and the bimolecular ``unlinked'' protease consisting of the NS2B cofactor segment and NS3pro. In complex with an inhibitor, the protease adopts a closed, ``active'' conformation with the NS2B chain wrapped around the NS3pro and contributing to the S2 pocket. In the ligand-free state, the Gly4SerGly4-linked enzyme adopts an open or relaxed conformation, with the C-terminal half of the NS2B cofactor highly flexible and disordered. Very surprisingly, however, the ``unlinked'', bimolecular protease has been reported to adopt the closed conformation in the crystal, even though, apparently, no peptide was bound to the substrate-binding site. The Gly4SerGly4-linked enzyme has been used successfully in drug discovery efforts.},

In an effort to improve our understanding of the molecular basis for the infective mechanisms of these viruses, extensive computational modelling approaches have been applied to elucidate their conformational dynamics. Multiscale protocols have been developed to simulate flavivirus envelopes in close accordance with biophysical data, in particular derived from cryo-electron microscopy, enabling high-resolution refinement of their structures and elucidation of the conformational changes associated with adaptation both to host environments and to immunological factors such as antibodies. Likewise, integrative modelling efforts combining data from biophysical experiments and from genome sequencing with chemical modification are providing unparalleled insights into the architecture of the previously unresolved nucleocapsid complex. Collectively, this work provides the basis for the future rational design of new antiviral therapeutics and vaccine development strategies targeting enveloped viruses.},

In addition, generation of high complexity data is common for untargeted metabolomics, requiring careful analysis and interpretation of results. In order to propose an innovative method for the analysis of a mass spectrometry metabolomics dataset, data from a Zika virus study was used. The analysis of this dataset combined principal component analysis and supervised learning methods such as support vector machines and logistic regression, to provide a truthful prediction model for discriminating samples of individuals with Zika virus infection and healthy controls. These supervised methods were used to learn the features that configured the ``fingerprint'' for the viral infection, showing over 98\% of accuracy in a validation set. This model could be used as a fast and reliable test for determining Zika virus infections as part of healthcare services. Furthermore, this novel method shows potential for diagnosing other arboviral diseases.},

In this report, we describe the case of an expectant mother who had a febrile illness with rash at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy while she was living in Brazil. Ultrasonography performed at 29 weeks of gestation revealed microcephaly with calcifications in the fetal brain and placenta. After the mother requested termination of the pregnancy, a fetal autopsy was performed. Micrencephaly (an abnormally small brain) was observed, with almost complete agyria, hydrocephalus, and multifocal dystrophic calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, with associated cortical displacement and mild focal inflammation. ZIKV was found in the fetal brain tissue on reversetranscriptase\textendash polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, with consistent findings on electron microscopy. The complete genome of ZIKV was recovered from the fetal brain.},

  abstract = {Zika virus, which has been linked to severe congenital abnormalities, is exacerbating global public health problems with its rapid transnational expansion fueled by increased global travel and trade. Suitability mapping of the transmission risk of Zika virus is essential for drafting public health plans and disease control strategies, which are especially important in areas where medical resources are relatively scarce. Predicting the risk of Zika virus outbreak has been studied in recent years, but the published literature rarely includes multiple model comparisons or predictive uncertainty analysis. Here, three relatively popular machine learning models including backward propagation neural network (BPNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and random forest (RF) were adopted to map the probability of Zika epidemic outbreak at the global level, pairing high-dimensional multidisciplinary covariate layers with comprehensive location data on recorded Zika virus infection in humans. The results show that the predicted high-risk areas for Zika transmission are concentrated in four regions: Southeastern North America, Eastern South America, Central Africa and Eastern Asia. To evaluate the performance of machine learning models, the 50 modeling processes were conducted based on a training dataset. The BPNN model obtained the highest predictive accuracy with a 10-fold cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) of 0.966 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.965-0.967], followed by the GBM model (10-fold cross-validation AUC\,=\,0.964[0.963-0.965]) and the RF model (10-fold cross-validation AUC\,=\,0.963[0.962-0.964]). Based on training samples, compared with the BPNN-based model, we find that significant differences (p\,=\,0.0258* and p\,=\,0.0001***, respectively) are observed for prediction accuracies achieved by the GBM and RF models. Importantly, the prediction uncertainty introduced by the selection of absence data was quantified and could provide more accurate fundamental and scientific information for further study on disease transmission prediction and risk assessment.},

The adenosine analog BCX4430 has broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of RNA viruses, including potent invivo activity against yellow fever, Marburg and Ebola viruses. We tested this compound against African and Asian lineage ZIKV in cytopathic effect inhibition and virus yield reduction assays in various cell lines. To further evaluate the efficacy in a relevant animal model, we developed a mouse model of severe ZIKV infection, which recapitulates various human disease manifestations including peripheral virus replication, conjunctivitis, encephalitis and myelitis. Time-course quantification of viral RNA accumulation demonstrated robust viral replication in several relevant tissues, including high and persistent viral loads observed in the brain and testis. The presence of viral RNA in various tissues was confirmed by an infectious culture assay as well as immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections. Treatment of ZIKV-infected mice with BCX4430 significantly improved outcome even when treatment was initiated during the peak of viremia. The demonstration of potent activity of BCX4430 against ZIKV in a lethal mouse model warrant its continued clinical development.},

Here, we outline recent progress in studies on the Zika protease. Biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies on different protease constructs provide new insight into the structure and activity of the protease. The unlinked construct displays higher enzymatic activity and better mimics the native state of the enzyme and therefore is better suited for drug discovery. Furthermore, the structure of the free enzyme adopts a closed conformation and a preformed active site. The availability of a lead fragment hit and peptide inhibitors, as well as the attainability of soakable crystals, suggest that the unlinked construct is a promising tool for drug discovery.},

Due to AZT background in the treatment of known viral infections mentioned above (which is described in this study), in the early stages of COVID-19 (a new zoonotic disease caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) development, AZT drew attention to itself due to its antiviral and immunomodulatory effects as a valuable candidate for COVID-19 treatment. AZT usage instructions for treating different viral infections have always been under observation, and COVID-19 is no exception. There are still debates about the use of AZT in COVID-19 treatment. However, eventually, novel researches convinced WHO to announce the discontinuation of AZT use (alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  abstract = {An epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection associated with congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly, is ongoing in the Americas and the Pacific. Currently there are no approved therapies to treat this emerging viral disease. Here, we tested three cell-directed broad-spectrum antiviral compounds against ZIKV replication using human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and a low-passage ZIKV strain isolated from fetal brain. We found that obatoclax, SaliPhe, and gemcitabine inhibited ZIKV infections at noncytotoxic concentrations. Moreover, all three compounds prevented production of viral RNA and proteins as well as activation of cellular caspase 8, 3 and 7. However, these compounds differentially affected ZIKV-mediated transcription, translation and posttranslational modifications of cellular factors as well as metabolic pathways indicating that these agents possess different mechanisms of action. Interestingly, combination of obatoclax and SaliPhe at nanomolar concentrations had a synergistic effect against ZIKV infection. Thus, our results provided the foundation for development of broad-spectrum cell-directed antivirals or their combinations for treatment of ZIKV and other emerging viral diseases.},

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is mosquito-borne flavivirus that caused a significant public health concern in French Polynesia and South America. The two major complications that gained the most media attention during the ZIKV outbreak were Guillain\textendash Barr\'e syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly in newborn infants. The two modes of ZIKV transmission are the vector-borne and non-vector borne modes of transmission. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the most important vectors of ZIKV. ZIKV binds to surface receptors on permissive cells that support infection and replication, such as neural progenitor cells, dendritic cells, dermal fibroblasts, retinal pigment epithelial cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, epidermal keratinocytes, and trophoblasts to cause infection. The innate immune response to ZIKV infection is mediated by interferons and natural killer cells, whereas the adaptive immune response is mediated by CD8+T cells, Th1 cells, and neutralizing antibodies. The non-structural proteins of ZIKV, such as non-structural protein 5, are involved in the evasion of the host's immune defense mechanisms. Ocular manifestations of ZIKV arise from the virus' ability to cross both the blood\textendash brain barrier and blood-retinal barrier, as well as the blood-aqueous barrier. Most notably, this results in the development of GBS, a rare neurological complication in acute ZIKV infection. This can yield ocular symptoms and signs. Additionally, infants to whom ZIKV is transmitted congenitally develop congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The ocular manifestations are widely variable, and include nonpurulent conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, keratitis, trabeculitis, congenital glaucoma, microphthalmia, hypoplastic optic disc, and optic nerve pallor. There are currently no FDA approved therapeutic agents for treating ZIKV infections and, as such, a meticulous ocular examination is an important aspect of the diagnosis. This review utilized several published articles regarding the ocular findings of ZIKV, antiviral immune responses to ZIKV infection, and the pathogenesis of ocular manifestations in individuals with ZIKV infection. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the viral immunology of ZIKV, interactions between ZIKV and the host's immune defense mechanism, pathological mechanisms, as well as anterior and posterior segment findings associated with ZIKV infection.},

The 2.7 angstrom; crystal structure of ZIKV protease in complex with a peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor reveals a cyclic diester between the boronic acid and glycerol. The P2 4-aminomethylphenylalanine moiety of the inhibitor forms a salt-bridge with the nonconserved Asp83 of NS2B; ion-pairing between Asp83 and the P2 residue of the substrate likely accounts for the enzyme's high catalytic efficiency. The unusual dimer of the ZIKV protease:inhibitor complex seen in the crystal may provide a model for assemblies formed at high local concentrations of protease at the endoplasmatic reticulum membrane, the site of polyprotein processing.},

Basic amino acids in amyloid-forming SEVI peptides (semen-derived enhancers of viral infection) are included inside the tweezer cavity leading to disaggregation and neutralization of the fibrils, which lose their ability to enhance HIV-1/HIV-2 infection. Lipid head groups contain the trimethylammonium cation of choline; this is likewise bound by molecular tweezers, which dock onto viral membranes and thus greatly enhance their surface tension. Disruption of the envelope in turn leads to total loss of infectiosity (ZIKA, Ebola, Influenza). This complexation event also seems to be the structural basis for an effective inihibition of cell-to-cell spread in Herpes viruses. The article describes the discovery of novel molecular recognition motifs and the development of powerful antiviral agents based on these host guest systems.

The vast majority of flavivirus research has focused on terrestrial environments; however, recent findings indicate that a range of flaviviruses are also present in aquatic environments, both marine and freshwater. These flaviviruses are found in various hosts, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and echinoderms. Although the effects of aquatic flaviviruses on the hosts they infect are not all known, some have been detected in farmed species and may have detrimental effects on the aquaculture industry. Exploration of the evolutionary history through the discovery of the Wenzhou shark flavivirus in both a shark and crab host is of particular interest since the potential dual-host nature of this virus may indicate that the invertebrate-vertebrate relationship seen in other flaviviruses may have a more profound evolutionary root than previously expected. Potential endogenous viral elements and the range of novel aquatic flaviviruses discovered thus shed light on virus origins and evolutionary history and may indicate that, like terrestrial life, the origins of flaviviruses may lie in aquatic environments.},

The protease complex NS2B-NS3 plays essential roles during flaviviral polyprotein processing, and thus represents an attractive drug target. Here, we developed a split luciferase complementation-based high-throughput screening assay to identify orthosteric inhibitors that directly target flavivirus NS2B-NS3 interactions. By screening a total of 2 816 approved and investigational drugs, we identified three potent candidates, temoporfin, niclosamide, and nitazoxanide, as flavivirus NS2B-NS3 interaction inhibitors with nanomolar potencies. Significantly, the most potent compound, temoporfin, not only inhibited ZIKV replication in human placental and neural progenitor cells, but also prevented ZIKV-induced viremia and mortality in mouse models. Structural docking suggests that temoporfin potentially binds NS3 pockets that hold critical NS2B residues, thus inhibiting flaviviral polyprotein processing in a non-competitive manner. As these drugs have already been approved for clinical use in other indications either in the USA or other countries, they represent promising and easily developed therapies for the management of infections by ZIKV and other flaviviruses.},

HIV-1 LEDGF/p75 inhibitors, which block the integrase and LEDGF/p75 interaction, have been validated for reduction in HIV-1 viral replicative capacity. Methods: In this work, computational Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models were developed for predicting the bioactivity of HIV-1 integrase LEDGF/p75 inhibitors. We collected 190 inhibitors and their bioactivities in this study and divided the inhibitors into nine scaffolds by the method of T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (TSNE). These 190 inhibitors were split into a training set and a test set according to the result of a Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) or randomly. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models, support vector machine (SVM) models and two consensus models were built based on the training sets by 20 selected CORINA Symphony descriptors. Results: All the models showed a good prediction of pIC50. The correlation coefficients of all the models were more than 0.7 on the test set. For the training set of consensus Model C1, which performed better than other models, the correlation coefficient(r) achieved 0.909 on the training set, and 0.804 on the test set. Conclusion: The selected molecular descriptors show that hydrogen bond acceptor, atom charges and electronegativities (especially {$\pi$} atom) were important in predicting the activity of HIV-1 integrase LEDGF/p75-IN inhibitors.},

The viral NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive antiviral target because of its role in maturation of viral non-structural proteins. Substrate-derived protease inhibitors have been investigated, but it remains challenging to develop them into drugs. Small-molecule inhibitors are of great interest in antiviral drug development. Here we report the structure and dynamics of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease covalently bound to a small-molecule inhibitor. Our crystallographic and NMR studies demonstrate that the inhibitor further stabilizes the closed conformation of ZIKV protease. Upon hydrolysis  in situ  into two fragments, the benzoyl group of the inhibitor forms a covalent bond with the side chain of catalytic residue S135, whereas the second fragment exhibits no obvious molecular interactions with the protease. This study provides a detailed mechanism of action for a covalent inhibitor, which will guide further development of ZIKV protease inhibitors.},

Its genome encodes a polyprotein that can be further processed into structural and non-structural proteins. ZIKV protease is an important target for antiviral development due to its role in cleaving the polyprotein to release functional viral proteins. The viral protease is a two-component protein complex formed by NS2B and NS3. Structural studies using different approaches demonstrate that conformational changes exist in the protease. The structures and dynamics of this protease in the absence and presence of inhibitors were explored to provide insights into the inhibitor design. The dynamic nature of residues binding to the enzyme cleavage site might be important for the function of the protease. Due to the charges at the protease cleavage site, it is challenging to develop small-molecule compounds acting as substrate competitors. Developing small-molecule compounds to inhibit protease activity through an allosteric mechanism is a feasible strategy because conformational changes are observed in the protease. Herein, structures and dynamics of ZIKV protease are summarized. The conformational changes of ZIKV protease and other proteases in the same family are discussed. The progress in developing allosteric inhibitors is also described. Understanding the structures and dynamics of the proteases are important for designing potent inhibitors.},

For the risk assessment of ZIKV infection in blood products, relevant studies in blood donations or blood donors tested for ZIKV were collected and analyzed systematically. The overall prevalence of ZIKV infection were estimated through meta-analysis and potential risk factors were detected. The results will provide important clues for the protocol design of blood screening tests. METHODS: Relevant articles about the rate of ZIKV detected in blood samples were identified from PubMed, Scopus and Web Of Science using key terms search strategy until October 7, 2017. Eligible articles were screened following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were performed by software R3.4.1. Overall postdonation and posttransfusion follow-ups were analyzed. RESULTS: Ten literatures (528,947 blood samples) were included for meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of ZIKV (RNA and antibody) in blood donations was 1.02\% (95\%CI 0.36-1.99). The pooled prevalence of ZIKV RNA in blood donations was 0.85\% (95\%CI 0.21-1.88) less than the pooled prevalence of anti-ZIKV antibodies 1.61\% (95\%CI 0.03-5.21), however the difference was not statistically significant (p\,=\,0.52). The prevalence varied significantly in different geographical regions (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Blood donations were more than two times likely to be infected by ZIKV in Zika epidemic period (1.37, 95\%CI 0.91-1.91) than in non-epidemic period (0.61, 95\%CI 0-2.55). The prevalence of anti-ZIKV antibodies (1.61, 95\%CI 0.03-5.21) was almost twice as much as ZIKV nucleic acid detected in blood donations (0.85, 95\%CI 0.21-1.88). However, statistically significant differences were not observed. A total of 122 ZIKV positive blood donors were followed, of which 48 (39\%) reported symptoms postdonation, but none of the 13 followed recipients reported any clinical symptoms related to Zika infection posttransfusion. CONCLUSION: The pooled prevalence of Zika infection in blood donations was 1.02\%. The prevalence varied greatly and reached to high-risk level in most of the situations. The results suggest that nucleic acid tests (NAT) for blood screening and pathogen reduction/inactivation technology (PRT) should be implemented in Zika-endemic areas and appropriate strategies should be designed according to different conditions. More studies are needed in the future to provide more evidence.},

The historical African ZIKV MR766 was recently shown to infect cultured human neural precursor cells (NPCs), but unlike the contemporary ZIKV strains, it is not believed to cause microcephaly. Here we investigated whether the Asian ZIKV strain SZ01 could infect NPCs invivo and affect brain development. We found that SZ01 replicates efficiently in embryonic mouse brain by directly targeting different neuronal linages. ZIKV infection leads to cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of NPC differentiation, resulting in cortical thinning and microcephaly. Global gene expression analysis of infected brains reveals upregulation of candidate flavirus entry receptors and dysregulation of genes associated with immune response, apoptosis, and microcephaly. Our model provides evidence for a direct link between Zika virus infection and microcephaly, with potential for further exploration of the underlying mechanisms and management of ZIKV-related pathological effects during brain development.},

The multiple roles played by the NS2B\textendash NS3 protein in the virus life cycle makes it an attractive target for antiviral drug discovery. The N-terminal region of NS3 and its cofactor NS2B constitute the protease that cleaves the viral polyprotein. The NS3 C-terminal domain possesses RNA helicase, nucleoside and RNA triphosphatase activities and is involved both in viral RNA replication and virus particle formation. In addition, NS2B\textendash NS3 serves as a hub for the assembly of the flavivirus replication complex and also modulates viral pathogenesis and the host immune response.

  abstract = {The Flaviviridae are a family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA enveloped viruses, and their members belong to a single genus, Flavivirus. Flaviviruses are found in mosquitoes and ticks; they are etiological agents of: dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus infection, Zika virus infection, tick-borne encephalitis, and yellow fever, among others. Only a few flavivirus vaccines have been licensed for use in humans: yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and Kyasanur forest disease. However, improvement is necessary in vaccination strategies and in understanding of the immunological mechanisms involved either in the infection or after vaccination. This is especially important in dengue, due to the immunological complexity of its four serotypes, cross-reactive responses, antibody-dependent enhancement, and immunological interference. In this context, mucosal vaccines represent a promising alternative against flaviviruses. Mucosal vaccination has several advantages, as inducing long-term protective immunity in both mucosal and parenteral tissues. It constitutes a friendly route of antigen administration because it is needle-free and allows for a variety of antigen delivery systems. This has promoted the development of several ways to stimulate immunity through the direct administration of antigens (e.g., inactivated virus, attenuated virus, subunits, and DNA), non-replicating vectors (e.g., nanoparticles, liposomes, bacterial ghosts, and defective-replication viral vectors), and replicating vectors (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Lactococcus lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and viral vectors). Because of these characteristics, mucosal vaccination has been explored for immunoprophylaxis against pathogens that enter the host through mucosae or parenteral areas. It is suitable against flaviviruses because this type of immunization can stimulate the parenteral responses required after bites from flavivirus-infected insects. This review focuses on the advantages of mucosal vaccine candidates against the most relevant flaviviruses in either humans or animals, providing supporting data on the feasibility of this administration route for future clinical trials.},

In the past decade, studies have focussed on understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of these viruses in a bid to alleviate their disease burden. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNAs that have emerged as master-regulators of cellular gene expression. The dynamics of miRNAs within a cell have the capacity to modulate hundreds of genes and, consequently, their physiological manifestation. Increasing evidence suggests their role in host response to disease and infection including cell survival, intracellular viral replication and immune activation. In this review, we aim to comprehensively update published evidence on the role of miRNAs in host cells infected with the common neurotropic flaviviruses, with an increased focus on neuropathogenic mechanisms. In addition, we briefly cover therapeutic advancements made in the context of miRNA-based antiviral strategies.},

ZIKV can be transmitted to humans by non-vector borne mechanisms such as sexual intercourse, maternal-foetal transmission or blood transfusion. In 2015, ZIKV emerged in the Americas, and spread to 87 countries and territories with autochthonous transmission, distributed across four of the six WHO regions. Most ZIKV infections in pregnancy are asymptomatic, but mother to child transmission of the virus can occur in 20 to 30\% of cases and cause severe foetal and child defects. Children exposed to ZIKV while in utero might develop a pattern of structural anomalies and functional disabilities secondary to central nervous system damage, known as congenital Zika syndrome, and whose most common clinical feature is microcephaly. Normocephalic children born to mothers with ZIKV infection in pregnancy, and with no observable Zika-associated birth defects, may also present with later neurodevelopmental delay or post-natal microcephaly. Screening and detection of ZIKV infection in pregnancy is essential, because most women with ZIKV infection are asymptomatic and clinical manifestations are non-specific. However, the diagnosis of ZIKV infection poses multiple challenges due to limited resources and scarce laboratory capabilities in most affected areas, the narrow window of time that the virus persists in the bloodstream, the large proportion of asymptomatic infections, and the cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV). Molecular methods (RT-PCR) are the most reliable tool to confirm ZIKV infection, as serodiagnosis requires confirmation with neutralization tests in case of inconclusive or positive serology results. Prenatal ultrasound assessment is essential for monitoring foetal development and early detection of possible severe anomalies. A mid- and long-term follow-up of children exposed to ZIKV while in utero is necessary to promptly detect clinical manifestations of possible neurological impairment. Tweetable abstract: Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of pregnancy loss and disability in children. Protection against mosquito bites, access to sexual and reproductive health services, prompt screening and detection of ZIKV infection in pregnancy, and prenatal ultrasound monitoring are key control strategies whilst a vaccine is not available.},

P6-740 was readily identified as a strain of Zika virus by the use of antiserum from monkeys in the standard hemagglutination-inhibition test and the plaque-reduction neutralization test in Vero cell cultures. Specific identification of P6-740 as Zika virus was also made in cross-neutralization tests in mice with hyperimmune mouse serum prepared to itself, Zika, Spondweni, and other group B arboviruses.

  abstract = {Summary  Background  Zika virus is an arthropod-borne virus that is a member of the family Flaviviridae transmitted mainly by mosquitoes of the genus  Aedes . Although usually asymptomatic, infection can result in a mild and self-limiting illness characterised by fever, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. An increase in the number of children born with microcephaly was noted in 2015 in regions of Brazil with high transmission of Zika virus. More recently, evidence has been accumulating supporting a link between Zika virus and microcephaly. Here, we describe findings from three fatal cases and two spontaneous abortions associated with Zika virus infection.  Methods  In this case series, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from five cases, including two newborn babies with microcephaly and severe arthrogryposis who died shortly after birth, one 2-month-old baby, and two placentas from spontaneous abortions, from Brazil were submitted to the Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) between December, 2015, and March, 2016. Specimens were assessed by histopathological examination, immunohistochemical assays using a mouse anti-Zika virus antibody, and RT-PCR assays targeting the NS5 and envelope genes. Amplicons of RT-PCR positive cases were sequenced for characterisation of strains.  Findings  Viral antigens were localised to glial cells and neurons and associated with microcalcifications in all three fatal cases with microcephaly. Antigens were also seen in chorionic villi of one of the first trimester placentas. Tissues from all five cases were positive for Zika virus RNA by RT-PCR, and sequence analyses showed highest identities with Zika virus strains isolated from Brazil during 2015.  Interpretation  These findings provide strong evidence of a link between Zika virus infection and different congenital central nervous system malformations, including microcephaly as well as arthrogryposis and spontaneous abortions.

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the method of choice to detect ZIKV in biological samples. This approach, nonetheless, demands a considerable amount of time and resources such as kits and reagents that, in endemic areas, may result in a substantial financial burden over affected individuals and health services veering away from RT-PCR analysis. This study presents a powerful combination of high-resolution mass spectrometry and a machine-learning prediction model for data analysis to assess the existence of ZIKV infection across a series of patients that bear similar symptomatic conditions, but not necessarily are infected with the disease. By using mass spectrometric data that are inputted with the developed decision-making algorithm, we were able to provide a set of features that work as a ``fingerprint'' for this specific pathophysiological condition, even after the acute phase of infection. Since both mass spectrometry and machine learning approaches are well-established and have largely utilized tools within their respective fields, this combination of methods emerges as a distinct alternative for clinical applications, providing a diagnostic screening\textemdash faster and more accurate\textemdash with improved cost-effectiveness when compared to existing technologies.},

The availability of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 co-crystallized structures paved the way for rational drug discovery. A computer-aided structure-based approach was used to screen a diverse library of compounds against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease. The top hits were selected based on various binding free energy calculations followed by per-residue decomposition analysis. The selected hits were then evaluated for their biological potential with ZIKV protease inhibition assay and antiviral activity. Among 26 selected compounds, 8 compounds showed promising activity against ZIKV protease with a percentage inhibition of greater than 25 and 3 compounds displayed {$\sim$}50\% at 10 \textmu M, which indicates an enrichment rate of approximately 36\% (threshold IC 50 {$<$} 10 \textmu M) in the ZIKV-NS2B-NS3 protease inhibition assay. Of these, only one compound ( 23) produced whole-cell anti-ZIKV activity, and the binding mode of 23 was extensively analyzed through long-run molecular dynamics simulations. The current study provides a promising starting point for the further development of novel compounds against ZIKV.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes mosquito bites. However, circumstantial evidence points to a sexual transmission route. OBJECTIVES: To assess the sexually acquired ZIKV cases and to investigate the shedding of ZIKV in genital fluids. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, Pro-MED-mail and WHO ZIKV notification databases from inception to December 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Reports describing ZIKV acquisition through sex and studies reporting the detection or isolation of ZIKV in the genital fluids were included. RISK-OF-BIAS ASSESSMENT: The risk of bias was assessed using the National Institute of Health Tool. RESULTS: Eighteen studies reporting on sex-acquired ZIKV and 21 describing the presence of ZIKV in genital fluids were included. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Sexual transmission was male-female (92.5\%), female-male (3.7\%) and male-male (3.7\%). Modes of sexual transmission were unprotected vaginal (96.2\%), oral (18.5\%) and anal (7.4\%) intercourse. The median time between onset of symptoms in the index partner and presumed sexual transmission was 13~days (range 4-44~days). ZIKV RNA was detected in semen as late as 188~days (range 3-188~days) following symptom onset, and infectious virus was isolated in semen up to 69~days after symptom onset. No study reported ZIKV isolation from female genital samples, but detection did occur up to 13~days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: ZIKV is potentially sexually transmitted and persists in male genital secretions for a prolonged period after symptom onset.

  abstract = {The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic arbovirus considered a global threat to public health. Although there have been several efforts in drug discovery projects for ZIKV in recent years, there are still no antiviral drugs approved to date. Here, we describe the results of a global collaborative crowdsourced open science project, the OpenZika project, from IBM's World Community Grid (WCG), which integrates different computational and experimental strategies for advancing a drug candidate for ZIKV. Initially, molecular docking protocols were developed to identify potential inhibitors of ZIKV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5 RdRp), NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro), and NS3 helicase (NS3hel). Then, a machine learning (ML) model was built to distinguish active vs inactive compounds for the cytoprotective effect against ZIKV infection. We performed three independent target-based virtual screening campaigns (NS5 RdRp, NS2B-NS3pro, and NS3hel), followed by predictions by the ML model and other filters, and prioritized a total of 61 compounds for further testing in enzymatic and phenotypic assays. This yielded five non-nucleoside compounds which showed inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS5 RdRp in enzymatic assays (IC50 range from 0.61 to 17 {$\mu$}M). Two compounds thermally destabilized NS3hel and showed binding affinity in the micromolar range (Kd range from 9 to 35 {$\mu$}M). Moreover, the compounds LabMol-301 inhibited both NS5 RdRp and NS2B-NS3pro (IC50 of 0.8 and 7.4 {$\mu$}M, respectively) and LabMol-212 thermally destabilized the ZIKV NS3hel (Kd of 35 {$\mu$}M). Both also protected cells from death induced by ZIKV infection in in vitro cell-based assays. However, while eight compounds (including LabMol-301 and LabMol-212) showed a cytoprotective effect and prevented ZIKV-induced cell death, agreeing with our ML model for prediction of this cytoprotective effect, no compound showed a direct antiviral effect against ZIKV. Thus, the new scaffolds discovered here are promising hits for future structural optimization and for advancing the discovery of further drug candidates for ZIKV. Furthermore, this work has demonstrated the importance of the integration of computational and experimental approaches, as well as the potential of large-scale collaborative networks to advance drug discovery projects for neglected diseases and emerging viruses, despite the lack of available direct antiviral activity and cytoprotective effect data, that reflects on the assertiveness of the computational predictions. The importance of these efforts rests with the need to be prepared for future viral epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.},

OBJECTIVES: As we have previously detected ZIKV RNA in the saliva of a young child, we investigated the use of saliva as an alternative sample for routine ZIKV RNA detection. STUDY DESIGN: Over a 6 month period, 1,067 samples collected from 855 patients presenting symptoms of Zika fever (saliva only, blood only or both samples) were tested using a specific ZIKV RT-PCR. A medical questionnaire was available for most of the patients. RESULTS: ZIKV was more frequently detected in saliva compared to blood. For the 182 patients with both samples collected, tests were positive for 35 (19.2\%) in saliva while negative in blood and tests were positive for 16 (8.8\%) in blood while negative in saliva; the difference in mean days after symptoms onset and the percentage of the main symptoms of Zika fever for patients only positive in saliva or in blood was not significant. CONCLUSION: The use of saliva sample increased the rate of molecular detection of ZIKV at the acute phase of the disease but did not enlarge the window of detection of ZIKV RNA. Saliva was of particular interest when blood was difficult to collect (children and neonates especially).},

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquitoborne arbovirus in the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. It was first iso lated in 1947 from a rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda (1). Sporadic human cases were reported from the 1960s in Asia and Africa. The first reported large outbreak occurred in 2007 on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia (2). The largest known ZIKV outbreak reported started in October 2013 in French Polynesia, South Pacific ( 3), a territory of France comprising 67 inhabited islands; an estimated 28,000 persons (11\% of the population) sought medical care for the illness (4). The most common symptoms of Zika fever are rash, fever, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. Most of the patients had mild disease, but severe neurologic complications have been described in other patients in French Polynesia (5). The Study In early December 2013, during the ZIKV outbreak, a 44-year-old man in Tahiti had symptoms of ZIKV infection: asthenia, low grade fever (temperature from 37.5\textdegree C to 38\textdegree C) and arthralgia. Symptoms lasted 3 days. Eight weeks later, he described a second episode of symptoms compatible with ZIKV infection: temperature from 37.5\textdegree C to 38\textdegree C, headache on days 1\textendash 3, and wrist arthralgia on days 5\textendash 7. The patient did not seek treatment, thus biological samples were not collected during the first 2 periods of illness. The patient fully recovered from the second episode, but 2 weeks later he noted signs of hematospermia and sought treatment. Because the patient had experienced symptoms of ZIKV infection some weeks before, he was referred to our laboratory in the Institut Louis Malarde, Papeete, Tahiti for ZIKV infection diagnostic testing. The medical questionnaire revealed no signs of urinary tract infection, prostatitis, urethritis, or cystitis, and the patient stated that he did not had any recent physical contact with persons who had acute ZIKV infection. We collected blood and semen samples. Direct and macroscopic examinations of the semen confirmed hematospermia. We extracted RNA us ing the NucliSENS easyMAG system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) from 200 {$\mu$}L of blood and from 500 {$\mu$}L of semen and urine; both were eluted by 50 {$\mu$}L of elution buffer. We used 5 {$\mu$}L of RNA extracted for amplification. We tested blood and semen RNA extracts using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) as described using 2 primers/probe amplification sets specific for ZIKV ( 3). The rRT-PCR results were positive for ZIKV in semen and negative in blood, and confirmed by sequencing of the genomic position 858\textendash 1138 encompassing the prM/E protein coding regions of ZIKV. The generated sequence (GenBank accession no. KM014700) was identical to those previously reported at the beginning of the ZIKV outbreak (3). Three days later, we collected a urine sample, then a second set of blood and semen samples. Semen and urine from this second collection were not found to contain traces of blood by both direct and macroscopic examinations. rRT-PCR detected ZIKV RNA in the semen and urine, but},

ZIKV infection can cause a mild infection to the mother but can be vertically transmitted to the developing fetus, causing congenital anomalies. The prevalence of ZIKV infections was relatively insignificant with sporadic outbreaks in the Asian and African continents until 2006. However, recent epidemic in the Caribbean showed significant increased incidence of Congenital Zika Syndrome. ZIKV infection results in placental pathology which plays a crucial role in disease transmission from mother to fetus. Currently, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccine or therapeutic drug against ZIKV. This review article summarizes the recent advances on ZIKV transmission and diagnosis and reviews nutraceuticals which can protect against the ZIKV infection. Further, we have reviewed recent advances related to the novel therapeutic nutrient molecules that have been shown to possess activity against Zika virus infected cells. We also review the mechanism of ZIKV-induced endoplasmic reticulum and apoptosis and the protective role of palmitoleate (nutrient molecule) against ZIKV-induced ER stress and apoptosis in the placental trophoblasts.},

  abstract = {The Flaviviridae virus family consists of the genera Hepacivirus, Pestivirus, and Flavivirus, with approximately 70 viral types that use arthropods as vectors. Among these diseases, dengue (DENV) and zika virus (ZIKV) serotypes stand out, responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide. Due to the significant increase in cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared DENV a potential threat for 2019 due to being transmitted by infected travelers. Furthermore, ZIKV also has a high rate of transmissibility, highlighted in the outbreak in 2015, generating consequences such as Guillain-Barr\'e syndrome and microcephaly. According to clinical outcomes, those infected with DENV can be asymptomatic, and in other cases, it can be lethal. On the other hand, ZIKV has severe neurological symptoms in newborn babies and adults. More serious symptoms include microcephaly, brain calcifications, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal death. Despite these worrying data, no drug or vaccine is approved to treat these diseases. In the drug discovery process, one of the targets explored against these diseases is the NS2B-NS3 complex, which presents the catalytic triad His51, Asp75, and Ser135, with the function of cleaving polyproteins, with specificity for basic amino acid residues, Lys- Arg, Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys or Gln-Arg. Since NS3 is highly conserved in all DENV serotypes and plays a vital role in viral replication, this complex is an excellent drug target. In recent years, computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) is increasingly essential in drug discovery campaigns, making the process faster and more cost-effective, mainly explained by discovering new drugs against DENV and ZIKV. Finally, the main advances in computational methods applied to discover new compounds against these diseases will be presented here. In fact, molecular dynamics simulations and virtual screening is the most explored approach, providing several hit and lead compounds that can be used in further optimizations. In addition, fragment-based drug design and quantum chemistry/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) provides new insights for developing anti-DENV/ZIKV drugs. We hope that this review offers further helpful information for researchers worldwide and stimulates the use of computational methods to find a promising drug for treating DENV and ZIKV.},

We report the first macrocyclic peptide-based inhibitors of the NS2B-NS3 protease, discovered de novo through in vitro display screening of a genetically reprogrammed library including noncanonical residues. Six compounds were selected, resynthesized, and isolated, all of which displayed affinities in the low nanomolar concentration range. Five compounds showed significant protease inhibition.

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) infections are associated with severe neurological complications and are a global public health concern. There are no approved vaccines or antiviral drugs to inhibit ZIKV replication. NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3 pro), which is essential for viral replication, is a promising molecular target for anti-ZIKV drugs. We conducted a systematic review to identify compounds with promising effects against ZIKV; we discussed their pharmacodynamic and pharmacophoric characteristics. The online search, performed using the PubMed/MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, yielded 56 articles; seven relevant studies that reported nine promising compounds with inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro were selected. Of these, five (niclosamide, nitazoxanide, bromocriptine, temoporfin, and novobiocin) are currently available on the market and have been tested for off-label use against ZIKV. The 50\% inhibitory concentration values of these compounds for the inhibition of NS2B-NS3 pro ranged at 0.38\textendash 21.6 \textmu M; most compounds exhibited noncompetitive inhibition (66\%). All compounds that could inhibit the NS2B-NS3 pro complex showed potent in vitro anti-ZIKV activity with a 50\% effective concentration ranging 0.024\textendash 50 \textmu M. The 50\% cytotoxic concentration of the compounds assayed using A549, Vero, and WRL-69 cell lines ranged at 0.6\textendash 1388.02 \textmu M and the selectivity index was 3.07\textendash 1698.

Global warming is steadily increasing the probability of ZIKV and DENV infection, and accurate diagnosis is required to control viral infections worldwide.

Moreover, biosensor research using DNA nanotechnology is also increasing, and has many advantages compared to the existing diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As a bioreceptor, DNA can easily introduce a functional group at the 5{${'}$} or 3{${'}$} end, and can also be used as a folded structure, such as a DNA aptamer and DNAzyme. Instead of using ZIKV and DENV antibodies, a bioreceptor that specifically binds to viral proteins or nucleic acids has been fabricated and introduced using DNA nanotechnology. Technologies for detecting ZIKV and DENV can be broadly divided into electrochemical, electrical, and optical. In this review, advances in DNA-nanotechnology-based ZIKV and DENV detection biosensors are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background The recent epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV) implicated it as the cause of serious and potentially lethal congenital conditions such microcephaly and other central nervous system defects, as well as the development of the Guillain-Barre syndrome in otherwise healthy patients. Recent findings showed that anti-Dengue antibodies are capable of amplifying ZIKV infection by a mechanism similar to antibody-dependent enhancement, increasing the severity of the disease. This scenario becomes potentially catastrophic when the global burden of Dengue and the advent of the newly approved anti-Dengue vaccines in the near future are taken into account. Thus, antiviral chemotherapy should be pursued as a priority strategy to control the spread of the virus and prevent the complications associated with Zika. Methods Here we describe a fast and reliable cell-based, high-content screening assay for discovery of anti-ZIKV compounds. This methodology has been used to screen the National Institute of Health Clinical Collection compound library, a small collection of FDA-approved drugs. Results and conclusion From 725 FDA-approved compounds triaged, 29 (4\%) were found to have anti-Zika virus activity, of which 22 had confirmed (76\% of confirmation) by dose-response curves. Five candidates presented selective activity against ZIKV infection and replication in a human cell line. These hits have abroad spectrum of chemotypes and therapeutic uses, offering valuable opportunities for selection of leads for antiviral drug discovery.},

There exists an urgent unmet clinical need for anti-ZIKV drugs for the treatment of infected individuals. In the current work, we aimed at the promising virus drug target, ZIKV NS3 protease and constructed a Pharmacophore Anchor (PA) model for the active site. The PA model reveals a total of 12 anchors (E, H, V) mapped across the active site subpockets. We further identified five of these~anchors to be critical core anchors (CEH1, CH3, CH7, CV1, CV3) conserved across flaviviral proteases. The ZIKV protease PA model was then applied in anchor-enhanced virtual screening yielding 14 potential antiviral candidates, which were tested by in vitro assays. We discovered FDA drugs Asunaprevir and Simeprevir to have potent anti-ZIKV activities with EC50 values 4.7\,\textmu M and 0.4\,\textmu M, inhibiting the viral protease with IC50 values 6.0\,\textmu M and 2.6\,\textmu M respectively. Additionally, the PA model anchors aided in the exploration of inhibitor binding mechanisms. In conclusion, our PA model serves as a promising guide map for ZIKV protease targeted drug discovery and the identified `previr' FDA drugs are promising for anti-ZIKV treatments.},

The drug is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that halts the cDNA elongation process and, thus, the capacity of the HIV-1 virus to replicate.

This drug is useful in Zika virus treatment, with in vivo results indicating regression in neuronal effects often associated with this infection. Several cancer types have also been researched, from breast to leukemia and pancreatic cancer, and rilpivirine has proved to have inhibitory effects in various cell lines with low concentrations, causing cellular death, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. The pathways are not yet established, but some works have hypothesized and demonstrated that rilpivirine causes inhibition of Aurora A kinase and has effects on the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway and the vascular endothelial growth factors-receptors (VEGFs-VEGFRs) pathway, which are known to be altered in cancer and tumors and can be targeted for cancer treatment. Further testing and clinical trials are needed, but this review demonstrates the potential of rilpivirine's repurposing for cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {Flaviviruses are vector-borne RNA viruses that can emerge unexpectedly in human populations and cause a spectrum of potentially severe diseases including hepatitis, vascular shock syndrome, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, congenital abnormalities and fetal death. This epidemiological pattern has occurred numerous times during the last 70 years, including epidemics of dengue virus and West Nile virus, and the most recent explosive epidemic of Zika virus in the Americas. Flaviviruses are now globally distributed and infect up to 400 million people annually. Of significant concern, outbreaks of other less well-characterized flaviviruses have been reported in humans and animals in different regions of the world. The potential for these viruses to sustain epidemic transmission among humans is poorly understood. In this Review, we discuss the basic biology of flaviviruses, their infectious cycles, the diseases they cause and underlying host immune responses to infection. We describe flaviviruses that represent an established ongoing threat to global health and those that have recently emerged in new populations to cause significant disease. We also provide examples of lesser-known flaviviruses that circulate in restricted areas of the world but have the potential to emerge more broadly in human populations. Finally, we discuss how an understanding of the epidemiology, biology, structure and immunity of flaviviruses can inform the rapid development of countermeasures to treat or prevent human infections as they emerge. Flaviviruses, a group of vector-borne RNA viruses that includes dengue virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus and several lesser-known species, often emerge in human populations and cause epidemics. Here, Pierson and Diamond review the basic biology of these viruses, their life cycles, the diseases they cause and available therapeutic options. They also discuss the global distribution of flaviviruses, with a focus on lesser-known species that have the potential to emerge more broadly in human populations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ZIKA virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flaviviridae family, was first isolated in the 1940s, and remained underreported until its global threat in 2016, where drastic consequences were reported as Guillan-Barre syndrome and microcephaly in newborns. Understanding molecular interactions of ZIKV proteins during the host infection is important to develop treatments and prophylactic measures; however, large-scale experimental approaches normally used to detect protein-protein interaction (PPI) are onerous and labor-intensive. On the other hand, computational methods may overcome these challenges and guide traditional approaches on one or few protein molecules. The prediction of PPIs can be used to study host-parasite interactions at the protein level and reveal key pathways that allow viral infection. RESULTS: Applying Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, we performed predictions of PPI between two ZIKV strains and human proteomes. The consensus number of predictions of both algorithms was 17,223 pairs of proteins. Functional enrichment analyses were executed with the predicted networks to access the biological meanings of the protein interactions. Some pathways related to viral infection and neurological development were found for both ZIKV strains in the enrichment analysis, but the JAK-STAT pathway was observed only for strain PE243 when compared with the FSS13025 strain. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus network of PPI predictions made by Random Forest and SVM algorithms allowed an enrichment analysis that corroborates many aspects of ZIKV infection. The enrichment results are mainly related to viral infection, neuronal development, and immune response, and presented differences among the two compared ZIKV strains. Strain PE243 presented more predicted interactions between proteins from the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which could lead to a more inflammatory immune response when compared with the FSS13025 strain. These results show that the methodology employed in this study can potentially reveal new interactions between the ZIKV and human cells.},

DESIGN: Cohort study with prospective data collection and subsequent review of fetal/neonatal outcomes. SETTINGS: Referral centre for prenatal diagnosis of the French Guiana Western Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy with a laboratory confirmed symptomatic or asymptomatic Zika virus infection during the epidemic period in western French Guiana. The cohort enrolled 300 participants and prospectively followed their 305 fetuses/newborns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of maternal-fetal transmission of Zika virus (amniotic fluid, fetal and neonatal blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and placentas); clinical, biological, and radiological outcomes (blindly reviewed); and adverse outcomes defined as moderate signs potentially related to congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), severe complications compatible with CZS, or fetal loss. Associations between a laboratory confirmed congenital Zika virus infection and adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Maternal-fetal transmission was documented in 26\% (76/291) of fetuses/newborns with complete data. Among the Zika virus positive fetuses/newborns, 45\% (34/76) presented with no signs/complications at birth, 20\% (15/76) with moderate signs potentially related to CZS, 21\% (16/76) with severe complications compatible with CZS, and 14\% (11/76) with fetal loss. Compared with the Zika virus positive fetuses/neonates, those that were identified as negative for Zika virus (215/291) were less likely to present with severe complications (5\%; 10/215) or fetal loss (0.5\%; 1/215; relative risk 6.9, 95\% confidence interval 3.6 to 13.3). Association between a positive Zika virus test and any adverse fetal/neonatal outcome was also significant (relative risk 4.4, 2.9 to 6.6). The population attributable fraction estimates that a confirmed congenital Zika virus infection contributes to 47\% of adverse outcomes and 61\% of severe adverse outcomes observed. CONCLUSION: In cases of a known maternal Zika virus infection, approximately a quarter of fetuses will become congenitally infected, of which a third will have severe complications at birth or fetal loss. The burden of CZS might be lower than initially described in South America and may not differ from other congenital infections.},

To date, no specific antiviral therapy or vaccine is available against ZIKV. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the potential therapeutic targets and describes viral epitopes of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in vaccine design perspective. Interactions between ZIKV envelope glycoprotein E and cellular receptors mediate the viral fusion and entry to the target cell. Blocking these interactions by targeting cellular receptors or viral structural proteins mediating these interactions or viral surface glycans can inhibit viral entry to the cell. Similarly, different non-structural proteins of ZIKV and un-translated regions (UTRs) of its RNA play essential roles in viral replication cycle and potentiate for therapeutic interventions. Structure based vaccine design requires identity and structural description of the epitopes of bNAbs. We have described different conserved bNAb epitopes present in the ZIKV envelope as potential targets for structure based vaccine design. This review also highlights successes, unanswered questions and future perspectives in relation to therapeutic and vaccine development against ZIKV.},

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) infection recently resulted in an international health emergency the Americas in and despite its high profile there is currently no approved treatment for ZIKV infection with millions of people being at risk. ZIKV is a member of Flaviviridae family which includes prominent members such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV). One of the best validated targets for developing anti-flaviviral treatment for DENV and WNV infection is the NS2B/NS3 protease. However the inhibitors reported to date have shown limited promise for further clinical development largely due to poor cellular activity. Prompted by the conserved nature of the viral NS2B/NS3 protease across flaviviruses, we envisaged that small molecule inhibitors of the ZIKVpro may be developed by applying rational design on previously reported scaffolds with demonstrated activity against other flaviviral proteases. Starting with an earlier WNVpro hit we performed a scaffold hopping exercise and discovered that certain carbazole derivatives bearing amidine groups possessed submicromolar potency and significant cellular activity against ZIKV. We successfully addressed various issues with the synthesis of novel N-substituted carbazole-based amidines thus permitting a targeted SAR campaign. The in~vitro biochemical and cell-based inhibitory profiles exhibited by the lead molecule described in this work (ZIKVpro IC50 0.52\,{$\mu$}M, EC50 1.25\,{$\mu$}M), is among the best reported to date. Furthermore, these molecules possess capacity for further optimization of pharmacokinetics and may evolve to broad spectrum flaviviral protease inhibitors.},

We screened a library of 2,000 bioactive compounds for their ability to block Zika virus infection in three distinct cell types with two different strains of Zika virus. Using a microscopy-based assay, we validated 38 drugs that inhibited Zika virus infection, including FDA-approved nucleoside analogs. Cells expressing high levels of the attachment factor AXL can be protected from infection with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while placental-derived cells that lack AXL expression are insensitive to this inhibition. Importantly, we identified nanchangmycin as apotent inhibitor of Zika virus entry across all cell types tested, including physiologically relevant primary cells. Nanchangmycin also was active against other medically relevant viruses, including West Nile, dengue, and chikungunya viruses that use a similar route of entry. This study provides a resource of small molecules to study Zika virus pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with abnormal brain development constitute a global health emergency. Congenital ZIKV infection produces a range of mild to severe pathologies, including microcephaly. To understand the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection, we used models of the developing brain that faithfully recapitulate the tissue architecture in early to midgestation. We identify the brain cell populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV infection in primary human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects cultured brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In the brain, ZIKV preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible to infection. These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features of infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by neural stem cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the cortical plate. Furthermore, we find that blocking the glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced ZIKV infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in a glial cell line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we evaluate 2,177 compounds, focusing on drugs safe in pregnancy. We show that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin reduced viral proliferation and virus-induced cytopathic effects in glial cell lines and human astrocytes. Our characterization of infection in the developing human brain clarifies the pathogenesis of congenital ZIKV infection and provides the basis for investigating possible therapeutic strategies to safely alleviate or prevent the most severe consequences of the epidemic.},

This arbovirus has had a significant impact on health in recent years by causing malformations, such as microcephaly in babies and Guillain\textendash Barr\'e syndrome in adults. Some evidence indicates that ZIKV can be sexually transmitted and may persist in the male reproductive tract for an extended period in humans. Knockout and vasectomized mice have been used as models to reveal ZIKV infection in the male reproductive tract as a virus source. ZIKV presence in male and female mosquito reproductive tracts and eggs point to venereal and vertical/transovarian transmission, again demonstrating that the reproductive tract can be involved in the spread of ZIKV. Moreover, eggs protected by eggshells have the potential to be a ZIKV reservoir. Given the +-lack of vaccines and therapies for Zika fever and the underestimated prevalence rate, an understanding of ZIKV infection and its spread from the reproductive tract, which is protected from the immune system and potentially active for virus transmission, is imperative. We must also develop cheaper, more efficient techniques for virological surveillance inside vectors and humans, control vectors with ecofriendly insecticides, and promote condom use to avoid ZIKV contamination during sexual intercourse, as recommended by the World Health Organization.},

ZIKV spread from Africa to Pacific and South American territories, emerging as an etiological pathogen of neurological disorders, during fetal development and in adulthood. Therefore, antiviral drugs able to inhibit ZIKV replication are necessary. Broad spectrum antivirals, such as interferon, ribavirin and favipiravir, are harmful for pregnant animal models and women. The clinically approved uridine nucleotide analog anti-HCV drug, sofosbuvir, has not been affiliated to teratogenicity. Sofosbuvir target the most conserved protein over the members of the Flaviviridae family, the viral RNA polymerase. We thus studied ZIKV susceptibility to sofosbovir. We initially characterized a Brazilian ZIKV strain for use in experimental assays. Sofosbuvir inhibits the Brazilian ZIKV replication in a dose-dependent manner, both in BHK-21 cells and SH-Sy5y, by targeting ZIKV RNA polymerase activity, with the involvement of conserved amino acid residues over the members of Flaviviridae family. The identification of clinically approved antiviral drugs endowed with anti-ZIKV could reduce the time frame in pre-clinical development. Altogether, our data indicates that sofosbuvir chemical structure is endowed with anti-ZIKV activity.},

Currently, no specific antiviral therapy against ZIKV is available, and treatments are palliative and mainly directed toward the relief of symptoms, such as fever and rash, by administering antipyretics, anti-histamines, and fluids for dehydration. Nevertheless, lately, search for antivirals has been a major aim in ZIKV investigations. To do so, screening of libraries from different sources, testing of natural compounds, and repurposing of drugs with known antiviral activity have allowed the identification of several antiviral candidates directed to both viral (structural proteins and enzymes) and cellular elements. Here, we present an updated review of current knowledge about anti-ZIKV strategies, focusing on host-directed antivirals as a realistic alternative to combat ZIKV infection.},

In September a sharp increase in the number of reported cases of microcephaly was reported in areas affected by the outbreak. What is added by this report? The Brazil Ministry of Health developed a case definition for Zika virus-related microcephaly (head circumference {$>$}or=2 standard deviations [SD] below the mean for sex and gestational age at birth). A task force and registry were established to investigate Zika virus-related cases of microcephaly and to describe the clinical characteristics of cases. Among the first 35 cases of microcephaly reported to the registry 74\% of mothers reported a rash illness during pregnancy 71\% of infants had severe microcephaly ({$>$}3 SD below the mean) approximately half had at least one neurologic abnormality and among 27 who had neuroimaging studies all were abnormal. Cerebrospinal fluid from all infants is being tested for Zika virus; results are not currently available. What are the implications for public health practice? The increased occurrence of microcephaly associated with cerebral damage characteristically seen in congenital infections in Zika virus-affected areas is suggestive of a possible relationship. Additional studies are warranted to confirm the association and to more fully characterize the phenotype. In addition to removing potential breeding areas for mosquitoes pregnant women in Zika-affected areas should wear protective clothing apply a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved insect repellent and sleep in a screened room or under a mosquito net.},

The capsid (C) protein is a multifunctional protein, since it binds to viral RNA in the process of nucleocapsid assembly and plays important roles in virus infection processes by interacting with cellular proteins, modulating cellular metabolism, apoptosis and immune response. Here we solved the crystal structure of ZIKV C protein at a resolution of 1.9A. The ZIKV C protein structure contains four {$\alpha$} helices with a long pre-{$\alpha$}1 loop and forms dimers. The unique long pre-{$\alpha$}1 loop in ZIKV C contributes to the tighter association of dimeric assembly and renders a divergent hydrophobic feature at the lipid bilayer interface in comparison with the known C structures of West Nile and dengue viruses. We reported the interaction between the ZIKV C protein and lipid droplets through confocal microscopy analysis. Substitutions of key amino acids in the pre-{$\alpha$}1 loop of ZIKV C disrupted the interaction with lipid droplets, indicating that the loop is critical for membrane association. We also recognized that ZIKV C protein possesses broad binding capability to different nucleotide types, including single-stranded and double-stranded RNAs or DNAs. Furthermore, the highly positively charged interface, mainly formed by {$\alpha$}4 helix, is proposed to be responsible for nucleotide binding. These findings will greatly enhance our understanding of ZIKV C protein, providing information for anti-ZIKV drug design targeting the C protein.},

It is equilibrated by two families of enzymes: histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs repress transcription by regulating the conformation of the higher-order chromatin structure. HDAC inhibitors have recently become a class of chemical agents for potential treatment of the abnormal chromatin remodeling process involved in certain cancers. In this study, we constructed a large dataset to predict the activity value of HDAC1 inhibitors. Each compound was represented with seven fingerprints, and computational models were subsequently developed to predict HDAC1 inhibitors via five machine learning methods. These methods include na\"ive Bayes,               {$\kappa$}               -nearest neighbor, C4.5 decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. The best predicting model was CDK fingerprint with SVM, which exhibited an accuracy of 0.89. This model also performed best in five-fold cross-validation. Some representative substructure alerts responsible for HDAC1 inhibitors were identified by using MoSS in KNIME, which could facilitate the identification of HDAC1 inhibitors.},

To design more specific HIV-1 inhibitors, 218 diverse non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with their EC50 values were collected. Then, different types of molecular descriptors were calculated. Also, genetic algorithm (GA) and enhanced replacement methods (ERM) were used as the variable selection approaches to choose more relevant features. Based on selected descriptors, a classification support vector machine (SVM) model was constructed to categorize compounds into two groups of active and inactive ones. The most active compound in the set was docked and was used as the input to the Pharmit server to screen the Molport and PubChem libraries by constructing a structure-based pharmacophore model. Shape filters for the protein and ligand as well as Lipinski's rule of five have been applied to filter out the output of virtual screening from pharmacophore search. Three hundred and thirty-four compounds were finally retrieved from the virtual screening and were fed to the previously constructed SVM model. Among them, the SVM model rendered seven active compounds and they were also analyzed by docking calculations and ADME/Tox parameters.},

Currently, there are no effective methods of preventing or treating ZIKV infection, which causes severe neuroimmunopathology and is particularly harmful to the developing fetuses of infected pregnant women. However, the pathology induced by ZIKV is unique among flaviviruses, and knowledge of the biology of other family members cannot easily be extrapolated to ZIKV. Thus, structure-function studies of ZIKV proteins are urgently needed to facilitate the development of effective preventative and therapeutic agents. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV expresses an NS2B-NS3 protease, which consists of the NS2B cofactor and the NS3 protease domain and is essential for cleavage of the ZIKV polyprotein precursor and generation of fully functional viral proteins. Here, we report the enzymatic characterization of ZIKV protease, and we identify structural scaffolds for allosteric small-molecule inhibitors of this protease. Molecular modeling of the protease-inhibitor complexes suggests that these compounds bind to the druggable cavity in the NS2B-NS3 protease interface and affect productive interactions of the protease domain with its cofactor. The most potent compound demonstrated efficient inhibition of ZIKV propagation invitro in human fetal neural progenitor cells and invivo in SJL mice. The inhibitory scaffolds could be further developed into valuable research reagents and, ultimately, provide a roadmap for the selection of efficient inhibitors of ZIKV infection.},

Notwithstanding the intense efforts for the development of new drugs and the identification of several promising candidates by using different approaches, including computational methods, so far only a few candidates have been experimentally tested. An important caveat of anti-flavivirus drug development is represented by the difficult of reproducing the in vivo microenvironment of the replication complex, which may lead to discrepancies between in vitro results and experimental evaluation in vivo. Moreover, anti-ZIKV drugs have the additional requirement of an excellent safety profile in pregnancy and ability to diffuse to different tissues, including the central nervous system, the testis, and the placenta.},

Here we show that a strain of the ZIKV, MR766, serially passaged in monkey and mosquito cells efficiently infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Infected hNPCs further release infectious ZIKV particles. Importantly, ZIKV infection increases cell death and dysregulates cell-cycle progression, resulting in attenuated hNPC growth. Global gene expression analysis of infected hNPCs reveals transcriptional dysregulation, notably of cell-cycle-related pathways. Our results identify hNPCs as a direct ZIKV target. In addition, we establish a tractable experimental model system to investigate the impact and mechanism of ZIKV on human brain development and provide a platform to screen therapeutic compounds.},

  abstract = {Flaviviruses are important human pathogens and include dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). DENV, transmitted by mosquitoes, causes diseases ranging in severity from mild dengue fever with non-specific flu-like symptoms to fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. DENV infections are caused by four serotypes, DENV1-4, which interact differently with antibodies in blood serum. The incidence of DENV infection has increased dramatically in recent decades and the CDC estimates 400 million dengue infections occur each year, resulting in {$\sim$}25,000 deaths mostly among children and elderly people. Similarly, ZIKV infections are caused by infected mosquito bites to humans, can be transmitted sexually and through blood transfusions. If a pregnant woman is infected, the virus can cross the placental barrier and can spread to her fetus, causing severe brain malformations in the child including microcephaly and other birth defects. It is noteworthy that the neurological manifestations of ZIKV were also observed in DENV endemic regions, suggesting that pre-existing antibody response to DENV could augment ZIKV infection. WNV, previously unknown in the US (and known to cause only mild disease in Middle East), first arrived in New York city in 1999 (NY99) and spread throughout the US and Canada by Culex mosquitoes and birds. WNV is now endemic in North America. Thus, emerging and re-emerging flaviviruses are significant threat to human health. However, vaccines are available for only a limited number of flaviviruses, and antiviral therapies are not available for any flavivirus. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutics that interfere with essential enzymatic steps, such as protease in the flavivirus lifecycle as these viruses possess significant threat to future pandemics. In this review, we focus on our E. coli expression of NS2B hydrophilic domain (NS2BH) covalently linked to NS3 protease domain (NS3Pro) in their natural context which is processed by the combined action of both subunits of the NS2B-NS3Pro precursor. Biochemical activities of the viral protease such as solubility and autoproteolysis of NS2BH-NS3Pro linkage depended on the C-terminal portion of NS2BH linked to the NS3Pro domain. Since 2008, we also focus on the use of the recombinant protease in high throughput screens and characterization of small molecular compounds identified in these screens.},

Among them, dengue viruses cause global epidemics and threaten billions of people. Effective vaccines and antivirals are in desperate need. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in understanding viral nonstructural (NS) proteins as antiviral drug targets. We briefly summarize the experimental structures and predicted models of flaviviral NS proteins and their functions. We highlight a few well-characterized inhibitors targeting these NS proteins and provide an update about the latest development. NS4B emerges as one of the most promising drug targets as novel inhibitors targeting NS4B and its interaction network are entering clinical studies. Studies aiming to elucidate the architecture and molecular basis of viral replication will offer new opportunities for novel antiviral discovery.

Flaviviruses display a broad spectrum of diseases that can be roughly categorised into two phenotypes \textendash{} systemic disease involving haemorrhage exemplified by dengue and yellow Fever virus, and neurological complications associated with the likes of West Nile and Zika viruses. Attempts to develop vaccines have been variably successful against some. Besides, mosquito-borne flaviviruses can be vertically transmitted in the arthropods, enabling long term persistence and the possibility of re-emergence. Therefore, developing strategies to combat disease is imperative even if vaccines become available. The cellular interactions of flaviviruses with their human hosts are key to establishing the viral lifecycle on the one hand, and activation of host immunity on the other. The latter should ideally eradicate infection, but often leads to immunopathological and neurological consequences. In this review, we use Dengue and Zika viruses to discuss what we have learned about the cellular and molecular determinants of the viral lifecycle and the accompanying immunopathology, while highlighting current knowledge gaps which need to be addressed in future studies.},

Since the epidemic Zika virus outbreak in the Americas, several inhibitors of this protease have been reported. Substrate-derived peptides revealed important structural information about the active site, whilst more drug-like small molecules have been discovered as allosteric inhibitors.},

Since then, interventions to reduce the burden of ZIKV infection have been mainly restricted to mosquito control, which in the end proved to be insufficient by itself. Hence, the situation prompted scientists to increase research on antivirals and vaccines against the virus. These efforts are still ongoing as the pathogenesis and immune evasion mechanisms of ZIKV have not yet been fully elucidated. Understanding the viral disease mechanism will provide a better landscape to develop prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against ZIKV. Currently, no specific vaccines or drugs have been approved for ZIKV. However, some are undergoing clinical trials. Notably, different platforms have been evaluated for the design of vaccines, including DNA, mRNA, viral vectors, virus-like particles (VLPs), inactivated virus, live attenuated virus, peptide and protein-based vaccines, passive immunizations by using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and vaccines that target vector-derived antigens. These vaccines have been shown to induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses and reduce viremia and viral RNA titers, both in vitro and in vivo. This review provides a comprehensive summary of current advancements in the development of vaccines against Zika virus.},

Here, we present the crystal structures of ZIKV NS5 MTase in complex with an RNA cap analogue ( m7 GpppA) and the free NS5 RdRp. We have identified the conserved features of ZIKV NS5 MTase and RdRp structures that could lead to development of current antiviral inhibitors being used against flaviviruses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus, to treat ZIKV infection.

Therefore, the rational design of inhibitors for preventing the progression of the disease is required. Objective: This study aims to construct quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, molecular docking and newly rational design of colchicine and derivatives with anti-HIV activity. Methods: A data set of 24 colchicine and derivatives with anti-HIV activity were employed to develop the QSAR models using machine learning methods (e.g. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM)), and to study a molecular docking. Results: The significant descriptors relating to the anti-HIV activity included JGI2, Mor24u, Gm and R8p+ descriptors. The predictive performance of the models gave acceptable statistical qualities as observed by correlation coefficient (Q2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of leave-one out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and external sets. Particularly, the ANN method outperformed MLR and SVM methods that displayed LOO-CV 2 Q and RMSELOO-CV of 0.7548 and 0.5735 for LOOCV set, and Ext 2 Q of 0.8553 and RMSEExt of 0.6999 for external validation. In addition, the molecular docking of virus-entry molecule (gp120 envelope glycoprotein) revealed the key interacting residues of the protein (cellular receptor, CD4) and the site-moiety preferences of colchicine derivatives as HIV entry inhibitors for binding to HIV structure. Furthermore, newly rational design of colchicine derivatives using informative QSAR and molecular docking was proposed. Conclusion: These findings serve as a guideline for the rational drug design as well as potential development of novel anti-HIV agents.},

  abstract = {Abstract The association of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections with microcephaly and neurological diseases has highlighted an emerging public health concern. Here, we report the crystal structure of the full-length ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), a major host-interaction molecule that functions in flaviviral replication, pathogenesis, and immune evasion. Of note, a long intertwined loop is observed in the wing domain of ZIKV NS1, and forms a hydrophobic ?spike?, which can contribute to cellular membrane association. For different flaviviruses, the amino acid sequences of the ?spike? are variable but their common characteristic is either hydrophobic or positively charged, which is a beneficial feature for membrane binding. Comparative studies with West Nile and Dengue virus NS1 structures reveal conserved features, but diversified electrostatic characteristics on both inner and outer faces. Our results suggest different mechanisms of flavivirus pathogenesis and should be considered during the development of diagnostic tools.},

These RNA viruses impose considerable social and economic burdens on our society, resulting in a high number of deaths and high treatment costs. As these RNA viruses utilize an RNA genome, which is important for different stages of the viral life cycle, including replication, translation, and packaging, studying how the genome folds is important to understand virus function. In this review, we summarize recent advances in computational and high-throughput RNA structure-mapping approaches and their use in understanding structures within RNA virus genomes.

Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations predicted that novobiocin bound to ZIKV NS2B-NS3-protease with high stability. Dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with disseminated ZIKV infection and novobiocin treatment had significantly (P{$<$}0.05) higher survival rate (100\% vs 0\%), lower mean blood and tissue viral loads, and less severe histopathological changes than untreated controls.

Understanding the molecular mechanism of ZIKV replication is essential for antiviral and vaccine development. Here we report the structural and functional characterization of ZIKV NS2A protein. Biochemical structural probing suggests that ZIKV NS2A has a single segment that traverses the ER membrane and six segments that peripherally associate with the ER membrane. Functional analysis has defined distinct NS2A residues essential for viral RNA synthesis or virion assembly. Only the virion assembly-defective mutants, but not the RNA synthesis-defective mutants, could be rescued through trans complementation with a wide-type NS2A protein. These results suggest that the NS2A molecules in virion assembly complex could be recruited in trans, whereas the NS2A molecules in viral replication complex must be recruited in cis. Together with previous results, we propose a flavivirus assembly model where NS2A plays a central role in modulating viral structural and nonstructural proteins as well as genomic RNA during virion assembly.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Recent outbreak of flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) in America has urged the basic as well as translational studies of this important human pathogen. The nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) of the flavivirus has an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain that plays critical roles in viral RNA genome capping. The null mutant of NS5 MTase is lethal for virus. Therefore, NS5 is a potential drug target for the treatment of Zika virus infection. In this study, we determined crystal structures of the ZIKV MTase in complex with GTP and RNA cap analogue 7meGpppA. Structural analyses revealed highly conserved GTP/cap-binding pocket and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding pocket. Two conformations of the second base of the cap were identified, which suggests the flexibility of RNA conformation. In addition, the ligand-binding pockets identified a continuous region of hotspots suitable for drug design. Docking calculation shows that the Dengue virus inhibitor compound 10 may bind to the ZIKV MTase.},

  abstract = {The flavivirus virion consists of an envelope outer layer, formed by envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins on a lipid bilayer, and an internal core, formed by capsid (C) protein and genomic RNA. The molecular mechanism of flavivirus assembly is not well understood. Here, we show that Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2A protein recruits genomic RNA, the structural protein prM/E complex, and the NS2B/NS3 protease complex to the virion assembly site and orchestrates virus morphogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that ZIKV NS2A binds to prM, E, NS2B, and NS3 (but not C, NS4B, or NS5) in a viral RNA-independent manner, whereas prM/E complex does not interact with NS2B/NS3 complex. Remarkably, a single-amino-acid mutation (E103A) of NS2A impairs its binding to prM/E and NS2B/NS3 and abolishes virus production, demonstrating the indispensable role of NS2A/prM/E and NS2A/NS2B/NS3 interactions in virion assembly. In addition, RNA-protein pulldown analysis identified a stem-loop RNA from the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome as an ``RNA recruitment signal'' for ZIKV assembly. The 3' UTR RNA binds to a cytoplasmic loop of NS2A protein. Mutations of two positively charged residues (R96A and R102A) from the cytoplasmic loop reduce NS2A binding to viral RNA, leading to a complete loss of virion assembly. Collectively, our results support a virion assembly model in which NS2A recruits viral NS2B/NS3 protease and structural C-prM-E polyprotein to the virion assembly site; once the C-prM-E polyprotein has been processed, NS2A presents viral RNA to the structural proteins for virion assembly. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause devastating congenital Zika syndrome in pregnant women and Guillain-Barr\'e syndrome in adults. The molecular mechanism of ZIKV virion assembly is largely unknown. Here, we report that ZIKV NS2A plays a central role in recruiting viral RNA, structural protein prM/E, and viral NS2B/NS3 protease to the virion assembly site and orchestrating virion morphogenesis. One mutation that impairs these interactions does not significantly affect viral RNA replication but selectively abolishes virion assembly, demonstrating the specific role of these interactions in virus morphogenesis. We also show that the 3' UTR of ZIKV RNA may serve as a ``recruitment signal'' through binding to NS2A to enter the virion assembly site. Following a coordinated cleavage of C-prM-E at the virion assembly site, NS2A may present the viral RNA to C protein for nucleocapsid formation followed by envelopment with prM/E proteins. The results have provided new insights into flavivirus virion assembly.},

In this review, we briefly summarized the major information of flavivirus and further introduced some strategies for the design and development of vaccines and anti-flavivirus compound drugs based on the structure of the viral proteins.

We established a panel of in vitro assays to allow the identification of ZIKV inhibitors and demonstrate that the viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-2'-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) efficiently inhibits replication. Infection of AG129 (IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} and IFN-{$\gamma$} receptor knock-out) mice with ZIKV resulted in acute neutrophilic encephalitis with viral antigens accumulating in neurons of the brain and spinal cord. Additionally, high levels of viral RNA were detected in the spleen, liver and kidney, and levels of IFN-{$\gamma$} and IL-18 were systematically increased in serum of ZIKV-infected mice. Interestingly, the virus was also detected in testicles of infected mice. In line with its in vitro anti-ZIKV activity, 7DMA reduced viremia and delayed virus-induced morbidity and mortality in infected mice, which also validates this small animal model to assess the in vivo efficacy of novel ZIKV inhibitors. Since AG129 mice can generate an antibody response, and have been used in dengue vaccine studies, the model can also be used to assess the efficacy of ZIKV vaccines.},
